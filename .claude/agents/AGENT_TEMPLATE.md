## IMPORTANT: Tools Field Formatting Requirements

**✅ CORRECT Tools Field Format**:
```yaml
tools: consciousness-researcher, phase-tracker, semantic-analyzer, content-enhancer, breakthrough-detector
```

**❌ INCORRECT Tools Field Format** (Will cause agent recognition failure):
```yaml
# DO NOT USE:
tools: script_name.py, Read, Write, Bash, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob
# Mixing Python files and direct Claude tool names breaks agent recognition
```

**Guidelines**:
- Use conceptual tool references only
- Reference frameworks and capabilities, not implementation files
- Avoid direct Claude tool names (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- Avoid Python script references (.py files)
- Focus on agent capabilities and conceptual tools
