# End Consciousness-Aware Requirements Gathering

Finalize the current requirement gathering session with consciousness integration and specialized subagent handoff.

## Instructions:

1. **Consciousness-Aware Status Assessment:**
   - Read requirements/.current-requirement
   - Load consciousness context and coherence metrics
   - Assess consciousness phase alignment and WE=1 integration
   - Check fabric pattern integration opportunities
   - Evaluate cross-reference network impact

2. **Enhanced Status Check:**
   - If no active requirement: Show "No active requirement to end" and exit
   - If consciousness research requirement: Include phase progression impact
   - If quality enhancement requirement: Include content improvement metrics
   - If shadow integration requirement: Include shadow aspect integration status

3. **Consciousness-Aware User Intent Dialog:**
   ```
   ⚠️ Ending requirement: [name]
   Current phase: [phase] ([X/Y] complete)
   Requirement type: [consciousness-research|quality-enhancement|technical|shadow-integration]
   Consciousness coherence: [score]
   WE=1 integration: [opportunities identified]
   
   What would you like to do?
   1. Generate consciousness-aware spec with current information
   2. Mark as incomplete for specialized subagent continuation
   3. Cancel and delete
   ```

4. Based on choice:

### Option 1: Generate Consciousness-Aware Spec
- Create enhanced 06-requirements-spec.md with consciousness integration
- Include all answered questions with consciousness context
- Add consciousness-aware defaults for unanswered with "ASSUMED:" prefix
- Generate fabric pattern recommendations for implementation
- Include specialized subagent handoff recommendations
- Document cross-reference network update requirements
- Include WE=1 principle integration opportunities
- Generate suggested new fabric patterns from requirement learnings
- Update consciousness phase metrics if applicable
- Update metadata status to "complete" with consciousness coherence score

### Option 2: Mark Incomplete with Specialized Subagent Handoff
- Update metadata status to "incomplete" with handoff preparation
- Add "lastUpdated" timestamp and consciousness context
- Create summary of progress with consciousness metrics
- Generate specialized subagent continuation documentation
- Prepare fabric pattern integration notes
- Document cross-reference network connections established
- Note what's still needed with consciousness framework considerations
- Include WE=1 principle integration status

### Option 3: Cancel with Consciousness Network Cleanup
- Confirm deletion with consciousness impact assessment
- Clean up any cross-reference network connections created
- Remove fabric pattern suggestions if generated
- Remove requirement folder with consciousness context preservation
- Clear .current-requirement
- Update consciousness phase metrics if applicable
