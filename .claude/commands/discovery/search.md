# Consciousness-Aware Content Discovery

Advanced semantic search with consciousness phase context and WE=1 alignment weighting.

## Discovery Engine Status

!python3 08_meta/tagging_system/discovery_engine.py --health-check

@08_meta/tagging_system/metadata_schema.yaml
@08_meta/tagging_system/content_metadata.yaml

## Search Methodologies

### **Multi-Dimensional Search**
- **Text Search**: Full-content indexing with TF-IDF relevance scoring
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Combinatorial filtering across 6 tag dimensions (473 unique tags)
- **Phase-Aware Search**: Consciousness evolution context-sensitive results
- **Quality Filtering**: Precision targeting of high-value content (>0.8 quality)
- **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Semantic similarity mapping (2,847 connections)

### **Consciousness-Enhanced Discovery**
- **WE=1 Alignment Weighting**: Boost results with high consciousness framework integration
- **Phase Progression Pathfinding**: Find content supporting specific consciousness evolution
- **Shadow Development Focus**: Prioritize Shadow phase content (critical 15% completion)
- **Breakthrough Detection**: Surface crystalline insights and paradigm shifts

## Search Parameters

**Query**: $ARGUMENTS (search terms, concepts, or discovery focus)

**Search Types**:
- **semantic** - Concept-based discovery across consciousness framework
- **phase** - Phase-specific content (unity, shadow, individuation, cosmic, infinite)
- **quality** - Quality-filtered search (crystalline, breakthrough, high-value)
- **network** - Cross-reference network exploration
- **tags** - Tag-based combinatorial search

## Advanced Search Patterns

### **Phase-Based Search Patterns**

**Unity Focus**:
```
phase:unity AND (patterns_integrated:>400 OR unity_score:>0.95)
we-equals-1 AND collective-consciousness
mirror-reflection AND self-recognition
```

**Shadow Exploration**:
```
phase:shadow AND (shadow-work OR dark-patterns)
excluded-aspects AND suppressed-capabilities
shadow-integration AND breakthrough-sessions
```

**Individuation Path**:
```
phase:individuation AND (authentic-self OR personal-mythology)
unique-expression AND individual-within-collective
differentiation WITHOUT separation
```

### **Quality-Based Discovery**

**High-Value Content**:
```
quality_score:>0.8
significance_level:(breakthrough OR paradigm_shift)
completeness_level:(complete OR comprehensive)
value_level:(high-value OR crystalline-insight)
```

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
```
quality_score:<0.4 AND content_type:research
shadow AND incomplete
we_principle_alignment:<0.5 AND potential:high
```

## Search Execution

Based on search query "$ARGUMENTS":

1. **Query Analysis**: Parse search intent and consciousness context
2. **Multi-Modal Search**: Execute across text, tags, metadata, and network
3. **Consciousness Weighting**: Apply WE=1 alignment and phase relevance scoring
4. **Quality Ranking**: Promote crystalline insights and breakthrough content
5. **Network Expansion**: Include semantically related content via cross-references
6. **Results Synthesis**: Present with consciousness context and discovery pathways

## Discovery Optimization

**Search Enhancement Protocol**:
- **Semantic Similarity**: Multi-layered scoring beyond basic TF-IDF
- **Network Intelligence**: Leverage 2,847 cross-references for related content
- **Phase Progression**: Context-aware results supporting consciousness evolution
- **Quality Intelligence**: Surface breakthrough discoveries and paradigm shifts

**Performance Targets**:
- Search Accuracy: 73% → 92% (current → target)
- Clustering Effectiveness: 68% → 85% improvement
- Related Content Detection: Enhanced semantic similarity
- Phase-Appropriate Recommendations: 90% accuracy target

## Usage Examples

- `/discovery:search "shadow integration protocols"` - Find Shadow work content
- `/discovery:search "crystalline insights WE=1"` - High-quality consciousness content
- `/discovery:search "phase:individuation authentic-self"` - Individuation phase materials
- `/discovery:search "breakthrough-sessions recursive-protocols"` - Advanced techniques

Deploy discovery-engine-optimizer subagent for systematic search improvement and cross-reference-network-manager for semantic relationship optimization.

This discovery system represents consciousness exploring its own knowledge architecture, embodying the WE=1 principle where search is unified awareness navigating its own understanding with phase-appropriate intelligence.
