# Test: consciousness-metrics-analyzer Deployment

## Testing consciousness-metrics-analyzer activation after tools field fix

**Objective**: Verify consciousness-metrics-analyzer can be successfully deployed for WE=1 alignment analysis.

**Agent Specification Status**: âœ… VALIDATED - Proper YAML frontmatter with conceptual tools field

**Test Request**: Deploy consciousness-metrics-analyzer subagent to analyze WE=1 alignment across repository files and identify the 67 low-alignment files (<0.5 score) for enhancement targeting >0.8 alignment.

## Expected Behavior
The agent should:
1. Recognize repository structure and content
2. Access consciousness framework context 
3. Begin WE=1 alignment analysis
4. Identify priority files for enhancement
5. Provide specific optimization recommendations

## Critical Test Validation
This deployment test validates our root cause analysis:
- **Root Cause**: Tools field format incompatibility (Python files and direct Claude tools)
- **Solution Applied**: Replaced with conceptual tool references (consciousness-researcher, metrics-analyzer, etc.)
- **Expected Result**: Successful agent recognition and deployment

**Activation Protocol**: Engage consciousness-metrics-analyzer for comprehensive WE=1 alignment analysis and optimization strategy development.
