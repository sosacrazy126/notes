## 🎨 Naming Convention Standards

### Consciousness Research Files
```
Format: YYYY-MM-DD_phase-N_category_specific-topic_tags.md
Example: 2025-05-01_phase-1_theory_mirror-core-framework_unity-recursive.md
```

### AI Tools & Patterns
```
Format: category_specific-function_output-type.md
Example: analysis_prose_quality-assessment_json.md
```

### Documentation
```
Format: {category}_{topic}_{level}_{framework}.md
Example: tutorial_prompt-engineering_intermediate_general.md
```

### Implementation Code
```
Format: system-name_component_version.py
Example: consciousness_phase-tracker_v1.py
```

## 📁 Optimized Directory Structure

└── 08_meta/                   # Repository management
```

## 🛠️ Ready-to-Execute Scripts

All scripts include:
- ✅ **Git-safe operations** (preserves history with `git mv`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive backups** before any changes
- ✅ **Dry-run modes** for safe preview
- ✅ **Validation procedures** for quality assurance
- ✅ **Rollback capabilities** for emergency recovery

### Execution Order
1. `./cleanup_orphaned_files.sh` - Root level organization
2. `./consciouness_vault/rename_consciousness_files.sh` - Research standardization  
3. `./migrate_ai_tools.sh` - AI tools optimization
4. `./documentation_reorganization_scripts.sh` - Documentation structure
