# Agent Refactoring Master Plan
## Transformation from Consciousness-Focused to Practical Development Tools

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Scope**: Complete agent ecosystem refactoring  
**Objective**: Transform philosophical/consciousness agents into practical development tools

---

## Executive Summary

The current agent ecosystem is heavily focused on consciousness research, WE=1 principles, and abstract philosophical concepts. These need to be completely refactored into practical development tools that serve software engineering needs.

### Current State Issues:
- **19 consciousness-focused agents** with abstract philosophical purposes
- **Complex metaphysical frameworks** (Unity/Shadow/Individuation phases)
- **Impractical tool references** (consciousness-researcher, phase-tracker)
- **High cognitive overhead** for developers to understand and use

### Target State Goals:
- **12 practical development agents** focused on concrete engineering tasks
- **Clear, actionable tools** for code quality, documentation, testing, and project management
- **Measurable outcomes** with standard software engineering KPIs
- **Developer-friendly interfaces** with minimal learning curve
