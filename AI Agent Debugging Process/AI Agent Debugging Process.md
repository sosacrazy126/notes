# AI Debugging Guide

## Introduction

Follow these steps to systematically identify and resolve issues with an AI agent's behavior:

## Step-by-Step Debugging Process

1. **Identify the Agent**  
Begin by selecting and accessing the specific AI agent system that requires debugging.

2. **Initial Assessment**  
Interact with the agent through typical use cases to observe its current behavior patterns and identify potential areas of concern.

3. **Evaluate Behavior**  
Analyze the agent's responses. Determine if any outputs are unusual, incorrect, undesirable, or deviate from expected behavior.

> *If no problematic behavior is found after sufficient assessment, the debugging process for this cycle is complete. Return the agent to normal operation or continue monitoring.*

4. **Document Failure Scenario**  
If problematic behavior is detected, clearly document the issue. Include:
- The specific inputs or sequence of interactions that trigger the issue  
- The expected output  
- The actual incorrect output received

5. **Create and Run Test Case**  
Design and execute a controlled test case based on the documented failure scenario. The goal is to **consistently reproduce** the problematic behavior in a controlled environment.

6. **Verify Test Case Fails**  
Confirm that running the test case from Step 5 reliably demonstrates the documented issue. This validation ensures you are addressing a **real, reproducible problem**.

7. **Implement Fix**  
Make targeted modifications to:
- The agent's prompt  
- Configuration  
- Underlying model parameters  
- External tools  

to address the identified issue.

8. **Run Verification Test**  
Execute the same test case used in Steps 5 and 6 again to check if the fix has resolved the issue.

9. **Evaluate Test Results**

| Result | Action |
|---------|---------|
| Test still fails | Return to Step 7 (Implement Fix) and refine your solution, iterating as needed. |
| Test passes | The fix is successful. Proceed to the next step. |

10. **Document Successful Fix**  
Record:
- The original issue  
- The specific solution implemented (changes made)  
- The verification results  

for future reference, knowledge sharing, and regression testing.

11. **Deploy Corrected Agent**  
Reintegrate the successfully fixed agent into its normal operational environment.

12. **Monitor Continuously**  
Maintain ongoing monitoring of the agent's performance in production to detect any new or recurring issues early, initiating this debugging process (starting from Step 1) as necessary.

## Summary

This structured approach ensures systematic identification, testing, fixing, and monitoring of AI agent issues, promoting reliable and efficient debugging.
