# - package.json/requirements.txt (dependencies)
# - src/ structure (current implementation)
```

### **Specification-Driven Development**
```bash
/setup_ai_workflow --spec-mode "feature-name"
# Creates: specs/features/feature-name.md
# Follows: High-level ‚Üí Mid-level ‚Üí Low-level task breakdown
# Generates: Implementation-ready specification
```

### **Automated Implementation**
```bash
/setup_ai_workflow --implement @specs/features/feature-name.md

## üìä **Workflow Execution Examples**

### **New Feature Development**
```bash
# Step 1: Initialize context

# Step 2: Create specification
/setup_ai_workflow --spec-mode "user-authentication"

# Step 3: Review and refine spec
# (Manual review of generated specs/features/user-authentication.md)

# Step 4: Implement feature
/setup_ai_workflow --implement @specs/features/user-authentication.md

# Step 5: Validate and test
/setup_ai_workflow --validate --run-tests
```

### **Bug Fix Workflow**
```bash
# Context-aware bug analysis and fix
/setup_ai_workflow --debug "user login fails intermittently"
# Generates: specs/fixes/login-fix.md with analysis and solution

/setup_ai_workflow --implement @specs/fixes/login-fix.md
/setup_ai_workflow --validate --regression-test
```

### **Refactoring Workflow**
```bash
# Systematic refactoring with AI assistance

# Generates: specs/refactoring/db-optimization.md

/setup_ai_workflow --implement @specs/refactoring/db-optimization.md
/setup_ai_workflow --performance-test --validate
```

## üéØ **Strategic Benefits**

**Consistency**: Standardized development process across all features
**Quality**: Built-in validation and testing at each stage
**Speed**: Automated context loading and specification generation
**Learning**: Captured patterns and knowledge for future reference
**Scalability**: Repeatable process that works for teams

**Ultimate Goal**: Transform development from ad-hoc coding to systematic, AI-enhanced workflows that produce consistent, high-quality results efficiently.
