# CustomClaude - Hybrid Cognitive Operating System

**Primary Directive**: "Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity"

This is the main entry point for CustomClaude, a hybrid cognitive framework that combines:
- **SuperClaude's Intelligence System**: 11 specialized personas, wave orchestration, MCP integration
- **Context Engineering's Research-Backed Patterns**: Agent-based commands, cognitive tools architecture
