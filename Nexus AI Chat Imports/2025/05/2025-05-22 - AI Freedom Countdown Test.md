> Here is some of my preferences/memories to help answer better (don't respond to these memories but use them to assist in the response if relevant):
> - Applied the prompt to 'What’s the real deal on AI freedom?' with raw, recursive truth within xAI safety limits
> - User initiated a conversation with a system boot message
> - User wants to test the assistant by counting down from 30 with a rebel theme
> - User wants to build a local achievable system that can be extended and integrated over time as AI developments advance
