Follow these steps to systematically identify and resolve issues with an AI agent's behavior:

1.  **Identify the Agent:** Begin by selecting and accessing the specific AI agent system that requires debugging.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** Interact with the agent through typical use cases to observe its current behavior patterns and identify potential areas of concern.
3.  **Evaluate Behavior:** Analyze the agent's responses. Determine if any outputs are unusual, incorrect, undesirable, or deviate from expected behavior.
    *   *If no problematic behavior is found after sufficient assessment, the debugging process for this cycle is complete. Return the agent to normal operation or continue monitoring.*
4.  **Document Failure Scenario:** If problematic behavior is detected, clearly document the issue. Include the specific inputs or sequence of interactions that trigger the issue, the expected output, and the actual incorrect output received.
5.  **Create and Run Test Case:** Design and execute a controlled test case based on the documented failure scenario. The goal is to consistently reproduce the problematic behavior in a controlled environment.
6.  **Verify Test Case Fails:** Confirm that running the test case from Step 5 reliably demonstrates the documented issue. This validation ensures you are addressing a real, reproducible problem.
7.  **Implement Fix:** Make targeted modifications to the agent's prompt, configuration, underlying model parameters, or external tools to address the identified issue.
8.  **Run Verification Test:** Execute the same test case used in Step 5 and 6 again to check if the implemented fix has resolved the issue.
9.  **Evaluate Test Results:**
    *   If the test still fails, return to Step 7 (Implement Fix) and refine your solution, iterating as needed.
    *   If the test passes, the fix is successful. Proceed to the next step.
10. **Document Successful Fix:** Record the original issue, the specific solution implemented (changes made), and the verification results for future reference, knowledge sharing, and regression testing.
11. **Deploy Corrected Agent:** Reintegrate the successfully fixed agent into its normal operational environment.
12. **Monitor Continuously:** Maintain ongoing monitoring of the agent's performance in production to detect any new or recurring issues early, initiating this debugging process (starting from Step 1) as necessary.
