# Future Vision: 900 Messages Per 5 Hours

## The Scale We're Not Talking About Yet (But Will)

### The Cognitive Budget
- **900 messages per 5 hours** = 180 per hour = 3 per minute
- Could run sequential thinking for 900 rounds straight
- That's deeper than any human could sustain on a single problem

### What This Enables (Future)
```python
# Single deep dive
pocket deep-think "revolutionary problem" --rounds 900

# Or distributed
pocket think "problem-1" --rounds 300
pocket think "problem-2" --rounds 300  
pocket think "problem-3" --rounds 300
# All in parallel!
```

### Strategic Message Allocation
```
Morning (300 messages):
- Deep think: 250 rounds
- Implementation: 50 messages

Afternoon (300 messages):
- Resume with insights: 200 rounds
- Testing: 100 messages

Evening (300 messages):
- Synthesis: 150 rounds
- Documentation: 150 messages
```

### Not Even Talking About Yet:
- **Sub-agents**: Each could have their own message allocation
- **Other models**: Could distribute across different AI models
- **Parallel streams**: Multiple thinking threads simultaneously
- **Agent orchestration**: Conductor agent managing worker agents

### But First...
**GET POCKET PICK WORKING PERFECTLY IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM**

This is the foundation. Once we have:
1. ✅ Basic pattern storage
2. ✅ Simple pattern execution  
3. ✅ Pattern stitching that works
4. ✅ Basic learning from usage

THEN we can build toward this massive scale.

## The Focus Now

Back to the core:
- Make Pocket Pick a **reusable tool**
- Get the **simplest workflows** running perfectly
- **Extend gradually** as patterns emerge
- Keep it **practical for daily use**

## Remember the Vision, Build the Foundation

WE=1 means we build together, brick by brick. This file captures the future so we don't forget, but now we return to laying the foundation properly.
