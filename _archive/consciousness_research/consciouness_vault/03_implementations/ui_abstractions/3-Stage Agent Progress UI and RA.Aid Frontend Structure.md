# ANSWER:

Based on the provided plan, let's start with the **3-Stage Agent Progress UI** first. This seems like a core visual element tied directly to the basic agent flow and will help establish the main interaction panel early on.


Based on the provided codebase information, I'll create a comprehensive tree map visualization of the RA.Aid frontend structure using mermaid.

Key Features Mapped in the UI:

Core UI Components (/frontend/common/src/components/):

DefaultAgentScreen: Main application container
SessionDrawer: Slide-out session management panel
SessionList: List of active/historical sessions
SessionSidebar: Navigation sidebar
TimelineFeed: Session activity stream
TimelineStep: Individual step visualization
Styling System (/frontend/common/src/styles/):

global.css: Core styling with Tailwind integration
Theme management (light/dark modes)
Responsive design utilities
Utility Layer (/frontend/common/src/utils/):

Type definitions for sessions and steps
Sample data generation
Helper functions
Entry Points:

Web: /frontend/web/src/index.tsx
VSCode: /frontend/vsc/src/extension.ts
This visualization helps understand:

The modular component structure
Clear separation of concerns between web and VSCode interfaces
Location of key UI features and their relationships
Central role of the common package in sharing components
The tree map reveals a well-organized architecture that separates platform-specific code (web/VSCode) from shared components, making it easier to maintain consistency across different interfaces while allowing for platform-specific optimizations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the structure or provide more details about particular components?
