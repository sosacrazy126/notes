# /suggest_pattern - Development & Analysis Pattern Assistant

```yaml
---
command: "/suggest_pattern"
category: "Development & Analysis"
purpose: "Intelligent fabric pattern recommendations for dev workflows and knowledge extraction"
wave-enabled: false
performance-profile: "standard"
---
```

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**

Smart fabric pattern recommendations focused on:
- **Development Workflows**: Code analysis, architecture decisions, implementation patterns
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Research analysis, insight extraction, learning workflows  
- **AI/Indie Workflows**: Modern development practices, automation, productivity patterns

## ⚙️ **Auto-Activation**

**Personas**: analyzer (code/research analysis), architect (system design), mentor (learning workflows)
**MCP**: Sequential (pattern analysis), Context7 (pattern docs), pocket-pick (pattern search)
**Tools**: [mcp__pocket-pick__pocket_pattern_search, mcp__pocket-pick__pocket_get_pattern, Read]

## 🚀 **Usage Patterns**

### **Development Focus**
```bash
/suggest_pattern "analyze this codebase for architectural improvements"
/suggest_pattern "extract best practices from this implementation" 
/suggest_pattern "understand this API design pattern"
```

### **Knowledge Extraction**
```bash
/suggest_pattern "extract key insights from research papers"
/suggest_pattern "analyze and summarize technical documentation"
/suggest_pattern "understand complex concepts from code/docs"
```

### **AI/Indie Workflows**
```bash
/suggest_pattern "optimize development workflow automation"
/suggest_pattern "analyze modern development practices"
/suggest_pattern "extract learnings from project retrospectives"
```

## 📊 **Pattern Categories**

**Primary Focus Areas**:
- **analyze_***: Code analysis, system understanding, research extraction
- **extract_***: Knowledge extraction, insight mining, learning synthesis  
- **create_***: Development artifacts, documentation, implementation guides
- **improve_***: Code quality, architecture, workflow optimization

## 📋 **Simple Output**

```markdown
## 🎯 **Recommended Pattern**
**Pattern**: pattern_name
**Use Case**: Brief explanation of when/why to use
**Command**: `echo "input" | fabric -p pattern_name`

## 💡 **Alternative Options**
- pattern_2 - For different approach/complexity
- pattern_3 - For specific edge cases
```

## 🎪 **Key Workflows**

### **Code Understanding**
```bash
# Analyze unfamiliar codebase
/suggest_pattern "understand this legacy system architecture"
# Output: analyze_code → extract_patterns → create_summary
```

### **Research & Learning**
```bash  
# Extract insights from technical content
/suggest_pattern "learn from this technical paper/tutorial"
# Output: extract_wisdom → summarize → extract_recommendations
```

### **Development Optimization**
```bash
# Improve development practices
/suggest_pattern "optimize my development workflow"
# Output: analyze_claims → extract_improvements → create_upgrade_plan
```

**Goal**: Quick, focused pattern recommendations that actually help with real development and learning tasks.
