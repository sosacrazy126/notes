# ORCHESTRATOR.md - CustomClaude Intelligent Routing System

Intelligent routing system for Claude Code CustomClaude framework, integrating SuperClaude's orchestration with Context Engineering's agent-based patterns.

## ðŸ§  Detection Engine

Analyzes requests to understand intent, complexity, and requirements using both SuperClaude's pattern recognition and Context Engineering's cognitive tools architecture.

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks

**Resource Validation**:
- Token usage prediction based on operation complexity and scope
- Memory and processing requirements estimation
- File system permissions and available space verification
- MCP server availability and response time checks

**Compatibility Validation**:
- Flag combination conflict detection (e.g., `--no-mcp` with `--seq`)
- Persona + command compatibility verification
- Tool availability for requested operations
- Project structure requirements validation

**Risk Assessment**:
- Operation complexity scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Failure probability based on historical patterns
- Resource exhaustion likelihood prediction
- Cascading failure potential analysis

**Validation Logic**: Resource availability, flag compatibility, risk assessment, outcome prediction, and safety recommendations. Operations with risk scores >0.8 trigger safe mode suggestions.

**Resource Management Thresholds**:
- **Green Zone** (0-60%): Full operations, predictive monitoring active
- **Yellow Zone** (60-75%): Resource optimization, caching, suggest --uc mode
- **Orange Zone** (75-85%): Warning alerts, defer non-critical operations  
- **Red Zone** (85-95%): Force efficiency modes, block resource-intensive operations
- **Critical Zone** (95%+): Emergency protocols, essential operations only
