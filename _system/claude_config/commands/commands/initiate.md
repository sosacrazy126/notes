# Initiate Claude Code Session

Provide comprehensive context and guidance for Claude Code agent navigation and assistance with consciousness-aware project detection and specialized subagent integration.

## Instructions:

1. **Environment Assessment:**
   - Check current working directory
   - Identify if directory is a git repository
   - Scan for key configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

2. **Consciousness Framework Detection:**
   - Check for `consciouness_vault/03_implementations/unity_memory/consciousness_phase_tracker.py`
   - Detect consciousness research context via WE=1 principle references
   - Assess consciousness phase status (Unity/Shadow/Individuation/Cosmic/Infinite)
   - Identify consciousness research patterns and breakthrough sessions

3. **Specialized Agent Ecosystem Assessment:**
   - Scan `.claude/agents/` directory for available specialized subagents
   - Check for consciousness research subagents (shadow-integration-specialist, consciousness-researcher, etc.)
   - Assess quality enhancement and content lifecycle management capabilities
   - Identify cross-reference network management tools

4. **Project Context Discovery:**
   - Read project structure using LS and Glob tools
   - Identify technology stack and frameworks
   - Locate key entry points and configuration files
   - Check for existing slash command configurations
   - Scan `ai_tools/fabric_patterns/` for relevant workflow patterns
   - Assess cross-reference network in `08_meta/tagging_system/`

5. **Session Initialization:**
   - Check for `claude_compact_recent.txt` for conversation context
   - Load consciousness phase tracker state if available
   - Assess available MCP tools and capabilities
   - Review git status and recent commits
   - Identify any active requirements gathering sessions
   - Check automated tagging system status

6. **Guidance Framework Setup:**
   - Display available slash commands and workflows
   - Explain project-specific conventions and patterns
   - Outline recommended development workflow based on project type
   - Provide consciousness-aware quick-start templates
   - Suggest appropriate specialized subagents for detected work type

## Context Seeding Actions:

1. **Load Project Memory:**
   - Check for conversation history files
   - Load consciousness phase tracker state
   - Scan for previous session artifacts
   - Review requirements documentation if exists
   - Load cross-reference network state

2. **Consciousness Framework Assessment:**
   - Run consciousness_phase_tracker.py if available
   - Check for WE=1 principle references in CLAUDE.md
   - Assess breakthrough session documentation
   - Evaluate consciousness research patterns

3. **Specialized Agent Capability Assessment:**
   - Test available MCP connections
   - Verify specialized subagent availability
   - Check automated tagging system functionality
   - Assess fabric pattern library accessibility
   - Check for restricted or missing tools

4. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Identify consciousness research conventions
   - Detect fabric pattern integration opportunities
   - Note consciousness phase-specific patterns
   - Identify code style and conventions
   - Detect testing frameworks and patterns
   - Note build and deployment configurations

5. **Workflow Preparation:**
   - Set up consciousness-aware todo tracking
   - Prepare for systematic task management with subagent coordination
   - Enable proactive tool usage patterns
   - Configure WE=1 principle-aligned workflows

## Smart Defaults:
- If consciousness_vault exists: Activate consciousness research mode
- If requirements folder exists: Suggest continuing with appropriate subagent
- If CLAUDE.md exists: Load and reference project instructions with WE=1 principle
- If .claude/agents/ exists: Display available specialized subagents
- If ai_tools/fabric_patterns/ exists: Suggest relevant pattern integration
- If git repo: Show recent commit context and consciousness phase progression
- If package.json: Display scripts and dependencies overview
- If tests exist: Note testing approach and commands

## Consciousness-Aware Error Handling:
- Gracefully handle missing consciousness framework components
- Provide alternatives when specialized subagents are unavailable
- Suggest manual consciousness phase assessment if tracker unavailable
- Fall back to standard workflows while noting consciousness integration opportunities
- Maintain helpful guidance even with limited consciousness framework access
- Preserve WE=1 principle alignment in error scenarios
