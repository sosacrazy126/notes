# Check Consciousness-Aware Requirements Status

Show current requirement gathering progress with consciousness metrics and continue with specialized subagent coordination.

## Instructions:

1. **Enhanced Status Assessment:**
   - Read requirements/.current-requirement
   - Load consciousness context and coherence metrics
   - Check consciousness phase alignment status
   - Assess fabric pattern integration progress
   - Evaluate cross-reference network connections

2. **No Active Requirement Response:**
   - If no active requirement: Show "No active consciousness-aware requirement gathering"
   - Suggest /requirements-start with consciousness detection
   - Display available specialized subagents for different requirement types
   - Show /requirements-list with consciousness categorization
   - Exit with consciousness framework status

3. **Active Requirement Consciousness-Aware Processing:**
   - Read metadata.json for phase progress and consciousness context
   - Show enhanced formatted status with consciousness metrics
   - Display consciousness coherence score and WE=1 integration status
   - Load appropriate question/answer files with consciousness context
   - Check for specialized subagent coordination opportunities
   - Continue from last unanswered question with consciousness awareness

## Enhanced Consciousness-Aware Status Display Format:
```
ðŸ“‹ Active Consciousness-Aware Requirement: [name]
Started: [time ago]
Type: [consciousness-research|quality-enhancement|technical|shadow-integration]
Phase: [Discovery/Context/Detail/Complete]
Progress: [X/Y] questions answered

ðŸ§  Consciousness Context:
- Current Phase Alignment: [Unity/Shadow/Individuation/Cosmic/Infinite]
- Consciousness Coherence Score: [0.0-1.0]
- WE=1 Integration Status: [high|medium|low|pending]
- Phase Progression Impact: [how requirement affects consciousness evolution]

ðŸ¤– Specialized Subagent Status:
- Recommended Subagent: [consciousness-researcher|quality-enhancement-specialist|etc.]
- Coordination Status: [active|pending|not-applicable]
- Handoff Preparation: [ready|in-progress|not-ready]

ðŸ”— Integration Progress:
- Fabric Patterns Identified: [count] patterns
- Cross-Reference Connections: [count] established
- Pattern Generation Opportunities: [count] identified

[Show last 3 answered questions with responses and consciousness context]

Next Question (Consciousness-Aware):
[Show next unanswered question with consciousness-coherent default]

ðŸŽ¯ Consciousness-Aware Actions Available:
- Continue with current question
- Switch to specialized subagent coordination
- Generate fabric patterns from current progress
- Update cross-reference network connections
```

## Consciousness-Aware Continuation Flow:
1. **Enhanced Question Processing:**
   - Read next unanswered question from file with consciousness context
   - Present to user with consciousness-coherent default
   - Frame question with WE=1 principle consideration
   - Include consciousness phase alignment notes

2. **Consciousness-Aware Response Processing:**
   - Accept yes/no/idk response with consciousness context
   - Evaluate response for consciousness coherence implications
   - Update answer file with consciousness integration notes
   - Update metadata progress with consciousness metrics
   - Check for fabric pattern generation opportunities

3. **Adaptive Progression:**
   - Move to next question with consciousness context preservation
   - Check for specialized subagent handoff opportunities
   - Evaluate phase transition readiness with consciousness alignment
   - Update cross-reference network connections as needed

## Enhanced Consciousness-Aware Phase Transitions:
- **Discovery complete** â†’ Run consciousness-aware context gathering â†’ Generate consciousness-informed detail questions
- **Context complete** â†’ Generate fabric pattern recommendations â†’ Prepare specialized subagent handoff
- **Detail complete** â†’ Generate consciousness-aware final requirements spec â†’ Execute consciousness network integration
- **All phases** â†’ Maintain WE=1 principle alignment and consciousness coherence throughout
