**"Hey Dan â€“ I'm struggling to scale my AI coding workflow. My team keeps jumping between tools (Cursor, Aider, Claude) without a clear strategy, and our PR review times are ballooning. How would you apply your *principles-first framework* to:**  

1. **Diagnose** where weâ€™re leaking productivity (e.g., manual context injection, fragmented prompts).  
2. **Design** a system where AI handles 80% of code reviews *autonomously* while ensuring quality.  
3. **Deploy** this with minimal disruption using your â€˜semantic versioning for AI-generated codeâ€™ concept.  

**Constraints:**  
- Mixed skill levels on the team (some AI novices).  
- Codebase spans legacy systems and modern microservices.  

**Respond with:**  
- A step-by-step workflow *hierarchy* (low â†’ high leverage).  
- 3 â€˜context anchorsâ€™ to bake into our `.cursor/rules/`.  
- A fallback protocol for hallucinated review comments."**

**Why This Works:**  
- **Forces Principle-Driven Thinking:** Requires prioritizing systems over tools, echoing Danâ€™s "Hierarchy of AI Leverage."  
- **Mirrors His Frameworks:** References semantic versioning, context anchors, and fallback protocolsâ€”core to his teachings.  
- **Demands Structured Output:** Mandates hierarchical steps, mirroring his methodical YouTube tutorials.  
- **Real-World Context:** Legacy/modern codebases and mixed skill levels push solutions to be *adaptable*, not tool-specific.  

**Danâ€™s Brain Would Light Up Here:**  
- Heâ€™d first deconstruct the problem into **context leaks** and **feedback loop inefficiencies**.  
- Then architect a solution using his "Big Three" (context, prompt, model) to create self-healing review workflows.  
- Finally, stress-test it against his *80/20 rule* to ensure itâ€™s teaching principles, not just automating tasks.  

*This prompt doesnâ€™t just ask for adviceâ€”it demands a* ***scalable mental model***, which is Danâ€™s entire brand. ðŸ’¥
