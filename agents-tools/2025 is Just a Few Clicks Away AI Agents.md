## Introduction to AI Agents and Prompt Engineering

### [00:00:00] Overview of AI Agents in 2025
- AI agents and next-generation language models are rapidly advancing.
- Local models like Quinn 2.5 prove that running AI locally is now feasible.
- **Prompt engineering** has evolved from a joke to a critical skill for 2025 and beyond.
- The prompt is described as the *new fundamental unit of knowledge work*.

### [00:01:00] Reviewing the Prompt as a Fundamental Unit
- Introduction of a **four-level prompt framework** to improve prompt quality and scalability.
- Demonstration of running prompts using terminal tools (`llm` and `olama`).
- Emphasis on rapid prototyping and experimenting with prompts across different models.

---

## Level 1: Basic Prompts

### [00:02:00] Running Simple Prompts
- Basic prompt example: sending a simple "ping" and receiving "pong".
- Tweaking prompts with keywords to change output format (e.g., Python, XML).
- Demonstrates how small changes in prompts can drastically alter outputs.
- Reinforces that prompt engineering is a real and valuable skill.

### [00:03:00] Exploring Model Options
- Listing available models including Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI.
- Running the same prompt on different models to compare outputs.
- Example: generating SQL table definitions in pseudo-JSON format.
- Testing local models like LLaMA 3.2 and Quinn 2.5 coder 14b with prompts.

### [00:05:00] Benefits of Terminal-Based Prompting
- Full control over prompt experimentation and model comparison.
- Ability to quickly iterate and test prompts on multiple models.
- Example of a shell script to run prompts across many models simultaneously.

## Level 2: Reusable Prompts with Static Variables

### [00:08:00] Creating Structured, Reusable Prompts
- Introduction of static variables and structured prompt formats (XML).
- Example: converting TypeScript interfaces to SQL tables with clear instructions.
- Adding and updating instructions to refine prompt behavior.
- Demonstrates improved performance and reusability compared to ad hoc prompts.

### [00:10:00] Running Reusable Prompts Across Models
- Using the reusable prompt with different inputs and models.
- Quinn 2.5 performs better with structured XML prompts than with simple ad hoc prompts.
- Encourages spending time refining prompt structure for better results.

### [00:12:00] Expanding Prompt Capabilities
- Adding instructions to generate SQL CRUD statements (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Shows how a single line addition can expand prompt functionality.
- Highlights the importance of understanding prompt levels and when to advance.

---

## Level 3: Prompt Templating with Examples

### [00:14:00] Using Examples to Guide Output
- Level 3 prompts include **concrete examples** to steer model responses.
- Example use case: summarizing content with a "spicy take" including sentiment and hot takes.
- Structured prompt with placeholders for instructions, example output, and content.

### [00:16:00] Creating and Testing a Summarization Prompt
- Building a prompt template with multiple sections: summary, main points, sentiment, biased hot takes.
- Running the prompt on a blog post by Simon Willison using Gemini Flash model.
- Outputs a well-formatted markdown summary with balanced perspectives.

### [00:19:00] Advantages of Level 3 Prompts
- Enables consistent, high-quality outputs across different chat interfaces and models.
- Allows rapid generation of diverse summaries or content based on examples.
- Demonstrates running multiple models in parallel to compare outputs.

## Level 4: Dynamic and Scalable Prompts

### [00:22:00] Scaling Prompts into Production-Ready Tools
- Level 4 prompts are **infinitely scalable** with dynamic variables and multiple examples.
- Example: generating YouTube video chapters with SEO keywords and timestamped transcripts.
- These prompts form the backbone of non-chatbot generative AI applications.

### [00:25:00] The Prompt as the Core of AI Tools
- Most generative AI applications are effectively level 4 prompts.
- Emphasizes the importance of mastering prompt design over relying on abstracted tools.
- The prompt is the *currency of the generative AI age* and the key to unlocking AI capabilities.

### [00:26:00] Building Personal Prompt Libraries and Tools
- Demonstrates a personal prompt library tool for managing and dynamically updating prompts.
- Encourages engineers to maintain prompt libraries for fast, ad hoc AI interactions.
- Highlights the trend of integrating prompts directly into AI tooling and workflows.
