>> You were likely working on a **multi-agent orchestration or task execution framework** where:
>> 
>> - **`task-master`** was your **central control module or execution orchestrator**, designed to delegate, route, or manage subtasks across tools, agents, or models.
>> - You connected it to a **Cursor + Claude integration**, which suggests:
>>   - You were using **Cursor IDE** as an environment (or its agent tooling) to automate or augment code-related tasks.
>>   - You integrated **Claude (Anthropic’s model)** via API to **run model-in-the-loop subtasks** inside the script (likely as part of a toolchain or sequence managed by task-master).
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧠 Most Likely Purpose:
>> 
>> You were testing or developing a **code execution and reasoning flow** where:
>> - `task-master` handles high-level task dispatch.
>> - `Cursor` provides an interface or plugin environment (possibly for local dev + agent support).
>> - `Claude` is invoked for specific subtasks like:
>>   - Code suggestion or explanation
>>   - Plan generation
>>   - Modular script writing or completion
>>   - Testing or auto-debugging
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🛠️ Example Use Case You May Have Been Running:
>> ```plaintext
>> Task: “Build a web scraper for job listings.”
>> 
>> → `task-master` parses this into:
>>    1. Generate plan → Claude (via cursor plugin or API)
>>    2. Write skeleton script → Claude
>>    3. Refine modules → Claude
>>    4. Run/debug → Cursor or local tool
>>    5. Save results → Filesystem or agent memory
>> ```
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔍 Likely Output Structure
>> You may have been writing JSON-based task configs, YAML prompt chains, or wrapping everything in a shell script or Python orchestration layer.
>> 
>> Would you like me to help reconstruct the last known state of `task-master`, or try recovering the pattern and logic of the Claude integration?

> # AI Services Module Documentation
> 
> ## Overview
> - **Type**: Core
> - **File**: ai-services.js
> - **Dependencies**: utils.js, Anthropic SDK, OpenAI SDK (optional)
> 
> ## Purpose
> Manages interactions with external AI services (Claude via Anthropic and optionally Perplexity via OpenAI) for task generation, analysis, and expansion.
> 
> ## Key Functions
> ```typescript
> // Main API interaction functions
> function callClaude(prdContent: string, prdPath: string, numTasks: number): Promise<Response>;
> function generateSubtasks(task: Task, numSubtasks: number, nextSubtaskId: number, additionalContext?: string): Promise<Subtask[]>;
> function generateSubtasksWithPerplexity(task: Task, ...args: any[]): Promise<Subtask[]>;
> 
> // Helper functions
> function handleStreamingRequest(response: Response): Promise<string>;
> function processClaudeResponse(response: string): Task[];
> ```
> 
> ## Module Relationships
> ```mermaid
> flowchart TD
>     A[ai-services.js] -->|Uses| B[utils.js]
>     A -->|Calls| C[Anthropic SDK]
>     A -->|Optional| D[OpenAI SDK]
>     E[task-manager.js] -->|Uses| A
>     F[commands.js] -->|Uses| A
> ```
> 
> ## API Integration
> - **External APIs**:
>   - Anthropic Claude API (Required)
>   - Perplexity API via OpenAI SDK (Optional)
> - **Authentication**:
>   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable required
>   - PERPLEXITY_API_KEY environment variable optional
> - **Rate Limits**: Follows standard Anthropic and OpenAI rate limiting
> 
> ## Critical Paths
> - **Entry Points**:
>   - callClaude(): Initial PRD parsing
>   - generateSubtasks(): Task expansion
>   - generateSubtasksWithPerplexity(): Research-backed expansion
> - **Exit Points**: 
>   - Structured task data
>   - Subtask arrays
>   - Error objects for failed calls
> - **Error Handling**:
>   - Retry logic for transient failures
>   - Graceful degradation when Perplexity unavailable
>   - Detailed error messages for debugging
> 
> ## Dependencies Graph
> ```mermaid
> flowchart TD
>     subgraph AIServices[ai-services.js]
>         A[API Clients]
>         B[Request Handlers]
>         C[Response Processors]
>     end
>     subgraph Dependencies[Direct Dependencies]
>         D[utils.js]
>         E[Anthropic SDK]
>         F[OpenAI SDK]
>     end
>     AIServices -->|uses| Dependencies
> ```
> 
> ## Configuration
> ```javascript
> const config = {
>   anthropic: {
>     model: process.env.MODEL || "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
>     maxTokens: parseInt(process.env.MAX_TOKENS) || 4000,
>     temperature: parseFloat(process.env.TEMPERATURE) || 0.7
>   },
>   perplexity: {
>     model: process.env.PERPLEXITY_MODEL || "sonar-medium-online"
>   }
> };
> ```
> 
> ## Testing Strategy
> - **Unit Tests**:
>   - Mock external API calls
>   - Test response processing
>   - Verify error handling
> - **Integration Tests**:
>   - Test with actual API calls
>   - Verify rate limiting handling
>   - Test fallback behaviors
> - **Mock Requirements**:
>   - Mock Anthropic SDK responses
>   - Mock OpenAI SDK responses
>   - Mock environment variables

>> Got it — this documentation clarifies what you were building with `task-master` and the Claude integration. Here's the big picture of what you were doing:
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧩 SYSTEM SNAPSHOT: TASK-MASTER × AI SERVICES MODULE
>> 
>> #### 🧠 **Primary Goal**
>> You were building an **AI-agent orchestrator** where `task-master` drives workflows by calling AI backends (Claude, optionally Perplexity) via `ai-services.js`, using structured functions to expand or analyze tasks programmatically.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### ⚙️ WHAT YOU HAD WIRED TOGETHER
>> 
>> | Component            | Role                                                                 |
>> |----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
>> | `task-master.js`     | Core orchestrator — issues commands, handles task graphs             |
>> | `ai-services.js`     | Unified interface to external LLMs (Claude/Perplexity)               |
>> | `Claude (Anthropic)` | Main engine for structured task generation + PRD expansion           |
>> | `Cursor + Claude`    | Possibly an in-IDE experience or a plug-in wrapper for Claude        |
>> | `Perplexity (optional)`| Secondary engine, used via OpenAI SDK, likely for external research |
>> | `utils.js`           | Handles helper logic for prompt formatting, validation, or parsing   |
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔄 FLOW YOU WERE PROBABLY TESTING
>> 
>> 1. **Input**: A PRD or task block (from CLI, file, or UI).
>> 2. **Claude Call** (`callClaude`):
>>    - Parses the PRD, returns task graph or structured list.
>> 3. **Subtask Expansion** (`generateSubtasks`):
>>    - Breaks tasks into executable subtasks using Claude.
>> 4. **Alt Path** (`generateSubtasksWithPerplexity`):
>>    - Supplements or augments tasks with research-based insights.
>> 5. **Output**: Validated, structured task array → fed into `task-manager`.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔐 ENV + CONFIG YOU WERE USING
>> 
>> ```js
>> process.env.MODEL = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
>> process.env.MAX_TOKENS = 4000
>> process.env.TEMPERATURE = 0.7
>> ```
>> 
>> You likely had `.env` file variables or runtime shell overrides active during script execution via `dotenv` or raw `process.env` usage.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧪 TESTING STATE SNAPSHOT
>> 
>> You had:
>> - **Unit tests** mocking Claude and OpenAI SDK
>> - **Integration tests** hitting real APIs for validation and retry logic
>> - Mocked env vars to simulate prod/dev conditions
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧠 MY GUESS ON WHAT YOU WERE *ABOUT TO BUILD NEXT*:
>> 
>> You were close to:
>> - Adding **task-type-specific handlers** (e.g., code-gen vs. research vs. API prototype tasks)
>> - Hooking `task-master` into a **CLI or TUI interface** for real-time task graph display
>> - Supporting **streaming Claude responses** (you already had `handleStreamingRequest` stubbed)
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> Would you like me to reconstruct a test scenario or helper script you might have used to verify the full Claude PRD expansion pipeline?
