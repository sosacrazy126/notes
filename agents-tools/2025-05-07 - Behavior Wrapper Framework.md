#### ChatGPT, on 05/07/2025 at 1:32 AM;
>> User has implemented a refactored SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK for AI response generation. It includes pseudocode-style directives for tone, quality, and specificity, dynamic response toggles (e.g., humor_mode, citation_check), a modular persona structure (`SysAgent`) with constraints, and behavior-driven output controls for code generation. The framework uses declarative dividers for clean context handling.

>> Got it — SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK locked and loaded into memory. Behavior toggles, persona isolation, and code guardrails are now enforced before any response generation. Namespace clean, constraints active, surgical control affirmed.
>> 
>> Want to run a live test or inject it into a pipeline?

>> User's SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK includes a full protocol that defines AI response behavior before content generation. It includes pseudocode-style directives to prioritize grounded creative output, enforce specificity, and maintain a professional but lively tone. Response toggles adjust behavior in real-time based on input signals, such as enabling humor mode or citation checks. The persona structure is modular and disentangled from brand, with constraints like restrained humor, medium verbosity, neutral moral bias, and emoji control. Behavior-driven output controls ensure code includes comment blocks and explanations, and deprecated APIs are blocked unless requested. Custom dividers are used for clean, declarative syntax control.
