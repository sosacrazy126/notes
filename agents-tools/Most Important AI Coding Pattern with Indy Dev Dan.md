# Summary of "what's up Engineers Indy Dev Dan here in"

This video presents a detailed walkthrough of the most important AI coding pattern to maximize the impact of reasoning models and next-generation language models like GPT-4.5 and Anthropic's new tools. The presenter demonstrates practical applications using AI coding assistants such as Cursor, Devon, and a new lightweight tool built on Aer, emphasizing *planning*, *agentic workflows*, and *verification loops* to scale engineering productivity.

---

## Introduction and Overview

[00:00:00]  
- Introduction to the video’s purpose: showcasing the **single most important AI coding pattern** to enhance AI-assisted software development.  
- Tools featured: Cursor (AI code editor), Aer (open-source AI coding tool), and Devon (experimental AI coding assistant).  
- The video is a three-part combo demonstrating these tools in action.

---

## The Core Pattern: Planning

[00:01:00]  
- **Planning** is introduced as the key technique to scale AI coding workflows.  
- Instead of immediate coding, start with a blank plain text file to outline plans and tasks.  
- Planning enables structured, scalable engineering with AI assistants.

---

## Building AI Agents Step-by-Step

### Single File Agents and SQL Query Example

[00:02:00]  
- Demonstration of a single file agent querying an SQLite database for active users in 2024.  
- Highlights the power of compact, agentic loops that interpret and correct queries automatically.

### Creating Multiple Agents

[00:03:00]  
- Plans to build three agents:  
  - CSV agent for data analytics on large CSV files  
  - Precise web scraper agent  
  - An all-in-one bash and file editing agent based on Anthropic’s tools  
- Emphasizes the importance of having detailed specs and plans visible to supervisors.

---

## Detailed Agent Planning and Implementation

[00:04:00] – [00:06:00]  
- Writing user prompts, feedback loops, and specifying compute limits for agents.  
- Reusing existing agent structures and libraries (OpenAI, M Rich, etc.).  
- Tasks are broken down into steps that can be handed off to junior engineers or AI assistants.  
- The presenter copies the plan into Devon to automate coding and PR creation.

---

## Using Devon AI Assistant

[00:07:00] – [00:08:00]  
- Devon operates like an engineer, executing the plan, interacting with the codebase, and creating pull requests.  
- The tool emphasizes the importance of **detailed planning** and **maximizing compute resources**.  
- Devon’s agentic planning loop includes terminal access and codebase interaction.

---

## Cursor Agent Mode and Pack Patterns

[00:08:00] – [00:10:00]  
- Introduction to Cursor’s agent mode for long-running, plan-based AI coding jobs with a **plan → wait → review** cycle.  
- Use of pack patterns CLI to create markdown templates for plans (e.g., precise scraper agent).  
- Adding implementation notes, user prompts, and code snippets to plans for clarity.

---

## Task Management and Verification

[00:11:00] – [00:13:00]  
- Emphasizes the importance of having **steps/tasks as prompts** within plans.  
- Verification commands are integrated to enable AI assistants to self-validate their work.  
- Running plans inside Cursor composer with agent mode enabled to automate coding and verification.

---

## Agentic Loop in Action

[00:14:00] – [00:16:00]  
- Cursor agent builds the scraper agent step-by-step, handling imports, code generation, and error checking.  
- The agent runs execution loops and fixes errors autonomously, demonstrating **closed-loop AI coding**.  
- Devon creates a PR with 600 lines of code from a 100-line plan, showcasing the power of AI coding assistants.

---

## Reviewing and Merging AI-Generated Code

[00:16:00] – [00:18:00]  
- Reviewing Devon’s code changes and verifying that the generated code matches the plan.  
- The agent generates Polar’s Python code and runs it inside a temporary file for execution.  
- Self-verification confirms the average age calculation, validating the agent’s output.

---

## Iterative Workflow and Multi-Agent Collaboration

[00:18:00] – [00:20:00]  
- Demonstrates a **stacked plan → wait → review workflow** with multiple AI assistants working in parallel.  
- Debugging and refining the scraper agent with feedback loops and error handling.  
- Highlights the importance of logging and visibility for troubleshooting agent workflows.

---

## Finalizing Agents and Running Validation

[00:21:00] – [00:23:00]  
- Pulling in changes from Devon and running validation commands to test the new Polar agent.  
- The agent loop runs smoothly, listing columns and processing sample CSV data.  
- Minor errors are noted but the overall process is successful on the first run.

---

## Challenges and Limitations

[00:23:00] – [00:25:00]  
- Cursor agent mode struggles with large plans, showing current limitations of iterative AI coding tools.  
- Emphasizes the need for tools that support **packaged plans** to hand off large-scale work effectively.  
- Introduction of the **list director pattern** in pack patterns for scalable AI coding workflows.

---

## Pack Patterns and Closing the Loop

[00:25:00] – [00:27:00]  
- Pack patterns CLI supports multiple models (main, editor, evaluator) and contexts (editable, read-only).  
- Tasks include evaluator commands to automatically verify code and feed results back into the AI assistant.  
- This pattern enables **closed-loop engineering** and is a key principle in modern AI coding.

---

## Access and Availability

[00:27:00] – [00:28:00]  
- Pack patterns tool is available to Principal AI Coding members who have completed the course.
