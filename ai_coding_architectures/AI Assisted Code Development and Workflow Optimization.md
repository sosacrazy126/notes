best practices recommended in your plan 

The devs thriving right now aren’t the best coders – they’re the best **AI workflow designers**. Every hour you spend manually coding is an hour not spent:

- Architecting systems AI can’t yet grasp
    
- Building leverage through compounding automation
    
- Solving higher-order problems

Generates comprehensive snapshots of your codebase in a structured format with XML-like tags, making it easy to share your project with chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude. 

This integration enables remote procedure execution through a standardized WebSocket protocol, allowing for distributed command execution within the  the agents  ecosystem.

#code ingestion and parsing ##


parses code, meaning it breaks it down into its fundamental elements. This inherently involves recognizing:
    - **Variables:** It identifies how variables are declared, assigned, and used throughout the codebase.
    - **Functions/Methods:** It understands function definitions, parameters, return values, and function calls.
    - **Classes/Objects:** In object-oriented languages, it analyzes class structures, inheritance, and object interactions.
    - **Data Structures:** It can discern how arrays, lists, dictionaries, and other data structures are employed.
- By building Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), Greptile creates a structured representation of the code, which allows it to understand the relationships between these elements.
- Graph analysis helps it visualize and analyze dependencies:
    - **Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops):** It traces how execution flows through the code, understanding `if/else` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and other control structures.
    - **Dependencies:** It maps out how different parts of the code rely on each other, such as function calls and variable dependencies.
