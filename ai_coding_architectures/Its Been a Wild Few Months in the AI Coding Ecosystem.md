# Summary of "it's been a wild few months in the AI"

This video explores recent advancements and workflows in AI-assisted coding, focusing on generative UI development using AI coding tools like AER and Cursor. It demonstrates how to build a client-server chat application with dynamic generative UI components, leveraging architect mode for improved AI code generation and parallel AI agents for efficient development.

---

## Introduction and Context

### [00:00:00] Overview of AI Coding Ecosystem
- Rapid evolution in AI coding tools with major players competing.
- Cursor gaining market share as a go-to AI editor.
- GitHub's revamped Copilot and rapid prototyping tool Spark.
- Anthropic releasing powerful bash and editor tools.
- Personal AI coding workflows have transformed significantly.

---

## Project Setup and Planning

### [00:01:00] Project Goal and Tools
- Build a simple generative AI UI client-server chat application.
- Use a chat interface to prompt generative UI components.
- Tools: AER and Cursor, combining closed and open source AI coding assistants.
- Emphasis on planning and specification for efficient AI coding.

### [00:02:00] Specification and AI Agents
- Specification divided into:
  - High-level overview
  - AI agent team (client, server, document editor, bash agent)
  - Task breakdown with detailed prompts
- Use of AER architect mode for high-quality code generation.
- Parallel execution of client and server AI agents.

---

## Documentation and Context Gathering

### [00:04:00] Adding Context and Documentation
- Add server and client files to AER instances with read-only separation.
- Collect documentation on tool calls and Vue.js dynamic components.
- Use Anthropic's tool to scrape and clean documentation for AI agents.
- Result: Clean, concise markdown files for AI context.

---

## AI Coding Workflow and Architect Mode

### [00:10:00] Initial Codebase and Prompt Endpoint
- Simple backend prompt endpoint using Anthropic chat call.
- Frontend built with Vue.js displaying messages and input field.
- Plan to convert responses into tool calls for generative UI.

### [00:11:00] Architect Mode in AER
- Architect mode runs prompts twice: planner and editor.
- Enables self-correction and confirmation of changes.
- Improves AI coding accuracy and workflow efficiency.

---

## Generative UI Implementation

### [00:13:00] Creating Tool Endpoint and Client Integration
- New tool endpoint created to handle generative UI components.
- Client updated to use tool calls on enter key press.
- Force tool mode ensures tool execution on every call.

### [00:15:00] Component Types and Dynamic UI
- Server defines component types (text, star rating, color picker, contact form).
- AI selects component type based on user input.
- Client dynamically renders components based on server response.

### [00:16:00] Enhancing Client Message Storage
- Message interface updated to store additional metadata.
- Parallel execution of client and server prompts speeds development.
- Separation of concerns reduces errors.

---

## Component Generation and Dynamic Rendering

### [00:18:00] Generating UI Components
- AI generates source components for each UI type.
- Frontend uses Vue.js dynamic components to render UI.
- Component map created to link component types to UI components.

### [00:22:00] Managing Component Responses
- Adjust response handling to correctly map component type and props.
- Remove unnecessary UI elements (e.g., submit button in text component).
- Dynamic UI updates based on user input and AI-generated components.

---

## Handling User Interaction and State

### [00:25:00] Submission Handling
- Update functions to handle submission responses for each component.
- Architect mode drafts changes; editor mode applies them.
- UI locks after submission to prevent further changes.
- Supports star rating, color picker, and contact form submissions.

---

## Backend Enhancements with Bash Agent

### [00:28:00] SQLite Database Setup
- Bash agent creates SQLite database and tables for message storage.
- Natural language commands automate backend setup.
- Validation commands confirm database structure.

### [00:30:00] Load and Save Endpoints
- Plan to add load and save endpoints to server.
- Client to call these endpoints on mount and key press.
- Demonstrates comprehensive planning and AI-assisted development.

---

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

### [00:31:00] Power of Planning and AI Agents
- Detailed specification documents enable efficient AI coding.
- Multiple AI agents working in parallel improve workflow.
- Architect mode enhances code quality via draft and edit cycles.

### [00:33:00] Emerging AI Coding Paradigms
- Upcoming 01 reasoning model promises further improvements.
- AI coding workflows will become more capable and autonomous.
- Encouragement to embrace specification-based AI coding for future projects.
