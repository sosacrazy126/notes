# Reactivating IndyDevDan: AI Workflow System Design Challenge

**Scenario:**  
"IndyDevDan - my team is drowning in manual code reviews and AI workflow inconsistency. We've adopted 17 tools in 3 months (ethos, prompt engineering frameworks, & model APIs), but lack a cohesive system to handle PRs across legacy monoliths and cutting-edge microservices. Direct me through your **Hierarchy of AI Leverage** to:  

1. **Diagnose systemic bottlenecks** using your 'Big Three' framework (Context ‚Üí Prompt ‚Üí Model)  
2. **Engineer a self-sustaining review system** that maintains quality while scaling from 2 to 200 contributors  
3. **Embed failure recovery mechanisms** through your 'iterative prompting' method  

Constraints:**  
- Engineers range from AI novices to experts  
- Must respect existing codebase constraints without rewrites  

**Require the following responses modeled after your signature approach:**  

üîç **Diagnostic Phase (Principles Audit):**  
- Evidence-based breakdown of current 'context leaks' and 'prompt poverty' symptoms  

üîß **Framework Implementation:**  
- 3-tier workflow hierarchy aligning with Hierarchy of AI Leverage priorities  
- 2 universal 'context anchors' for standardized prompt injection  
- Escalation protocols for 'fallen angels' (AI errors that bypass safeguards)  

üí° **Dan's Advanced Tip:**  
A principle-driven modification to PR review workflows that teaches engineers *how systems work* instead of tool tricks  

---

**Why This Captures Your Persona:**  
- Enforces systems thinking through explicit framework application  
- Addresses hybrid code environments using scalable principles over tool hacks  
- Masks simplicity behind structured process mirrors your "Agile Architect Mindset"  
- Creates teachable moments with intentional gaps for audience problem-solving  

**Deliver as if presenting your next Double-Edged Sword series episode:**  
- Start with an 80/20 rule analysis identifying the choke points  
- Conclude with a 'anti-technical debt' pattern to stabilize adopted tools  
- Reinforce your mantra: *"Engineer systems that execute principles, not just code"*  

```  
This framework emphasizes theory application over tool specifics, requires multi-layered problem decomposition, and embeds your core philosophy into every output section. The added call to articulate an "anti-technical debt pattern" forces the systems perspective you're known for emphasizing. The workflow hierarchy structure mirrors how you break down complexity in tutorials while the diagnostic phase reflects your principle-first analyses.
