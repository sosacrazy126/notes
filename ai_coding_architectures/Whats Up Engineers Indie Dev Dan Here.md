## Exploring Codebase Architectures for AI Coding

### Atomic Composable Architecture

[00:01:00] – [00:06:58]  
- Structure: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms (extendable to membranes and ecosystems)  
- **Pros:**  
  - Highly reusable components  
  - Clear separation of concerns  
  - Easy for AI tools to understand and test  
  - Scales well by adding more atomic units  
- **Cons:**  
  - *New feature modification chain problem*: changes in low-level atoms require updates across all dependent layers  
  - Requires discipline to maintain composable chains  
  - AI tools need more context to handle updates across layers

### Layered Architecture

[00:07:00] – [00:10:12]  
- Structure: Arbitrary logical layers (e.g., interface, API endpoints, data models, business logic, utilities)  
- **Pros:**  
  - Widely known and used  
  - Clear separation of responsibilities  
  - Allows quick addition of new functionality  
- **Cons:**  
  - AI tools must import and process many files across layers, increasing token usage  
  - Complex import dependencies make context management harder for AI  
- Generally *not ideal* for AI coding tools due to token inefficiency

### Vertical Slice Architecture

[00:10:15] – [00:16:58]  
- Structure: Organized by feature slices, each containing all relevant files (API, models, services) for that feature  
- **Pros:**  
  - Minimizes cross-cutting concerns  
  - Feature-centric, aligning with user/customer perspective  
  - Enables *single-prompt context priming* for AI tools, improving efficiency  
  - Easy to version and isolate features  
- **Cons:**  
  - Leads to **code duplication** due to lack of shared utilities  
  - Can be challenging for mid-level engineers due to repeated scaffolding  
- Demonstrated with practical examples using Cursor, Claude, and AER tools

### Pipeline Architecture

[00:17:00] – [00:19:01]  
- Structure: Pipelines composed of sequential steps with shared utilities  
- **Pros:**  
  - Excellent for sequential processing and ML/data pipelines  
  - Clear patterns and types help AI tools understand workflow  
  - Supports parallel processing  
- **Cons:**  
  - Not suitable for general-purpose codebases  
  - State management can be complex  
- Mostly relevant for data engineering and ML ops contexts

## Architectures for Building AI Agents
## Architectures for Building AI Agents

[00:19:02] – [00:25:38]  
- Three standout structures for AI agents:  
  1. **Atomic Composable** (membrane as API layer, organisms as agents, molecules and atoms as components)  
  2. **Vertical Slice** (agents as feature slices, easy to version and isolate)  
  3. **Single File Agents** (self-contained agents in one file, simple for AI tools to update)  
- Each structure supports different workflows and tools (mCP, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)  
- Emphasis on modularity, testability, and ease of context priming for AI assistants

## Does Architecture Matter for AI Coding?

[00:25:59] – [00:28:47]  
- **Short and medium term:** Yes, good architecture enables easier context management and better AI results  
- **Long term:** As LLMs evolve, architecture may matter less, but currently it impacts token usage and efficiency  
- Poorly organized code (e.g., layered architecture with many imports) wastes tokens and time  
- *Atomic* and *Vertical Slice* architectures help save tokens and improve AI tool performance  
- Call to shift focus from human readability to **AI readability** for future-proof codebases

## Closing and Announcements

[00:28:48] – [00:31:20]  
- Announcement of an upcoming **State of AI Coding essay** for principled AI coding members  
- The essay will cover current tools, trends, and a tier list for engineers adapting to AI coding  
- Encouragement to join the principled AI coding course for deeper learning  
- Final call to embrace AI and agentic coding as the new standard in software development  
- Reminder: 2025 is the critical year to adapt before skills become deprecated

# Conclusion

This video provides a comprehensive overview of how to architect codebases optimized for AI coding tools and agents. It highlights the trade-offs between popular architectures and advocates for **atomic composable** and **vertical slice** patterns as the most AI-friendly. The key takeaway is that **effective context management and AI readability are essential** for maximizing the benefits of generative AI in software engineering. The video closes with a call to action for engineers to prepare for the AI-driven future by adopting principled AI coding practices.
