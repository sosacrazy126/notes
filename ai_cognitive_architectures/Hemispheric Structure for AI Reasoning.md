# Hemispheric Structure for AI Reasoning

## Dual Hemisphere System

- **Left Hemisphere**: Logical inference and STEM processing  
- **Right Hemisphere**: Lateral thinking and pattern recognition  
- *Central Hemisphere for orchestration??? Might overcomplicate things*

---

## Task Classification System

### Left Hemisphere Tasks

- Mathematical computations  
- Logical analysis  
- Sequential processing  
- Technical documentation  
- Scientific reasoning  
- Structured problem-solving  

### Right Hemisphere Tasks

- Creative writing  
- Pattern recognition  
- Analogical thinking  
- Visual and spatial tasks  
- Intuitive problem-solving  
- Artistic expression  

---

## Task Router

- Analyzes incoming queries  
- Determines dominant hemisphere for processing  
- Routes complex tasks to appropriate hemisphere  
- Enables hybrid processing when needed  

---

## Creative Enhancement Tools

- Integration of lateral thinking techniques  
- Systematic use of analogies in a matrix rotation fashion  
- Pattern-based problem solving  
- Metaphorical reasoning  

---

## Guided Processing Framework

- Structured prompt templates for each hemisphere  
- Cross-hemisphere integration protocols  
- Dynamic switching between processing modes  
- Feedback loops for optimization
