EXPLANATION:  
The phrase "maintains consistency with existing architectures" indicates a design or development approach that ensures new systems, components, or changes align with the structure, patterns, and technologies already in use within an organization's technical stack. This promotes compatibility, reduces integration complexity, simplifies maintenance, and ensures long-term scalability and stability of the overall system.
