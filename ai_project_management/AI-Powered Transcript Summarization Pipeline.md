# Transcript Summarization Pipeline Overview

---

## Concept Description

A sophisticated transcript summarization pipeline blending AI models (**QwenVL 2**, **Gemini**) and structured workflows for enterprise reliability. Key features include:

- **Hybrid extraction**
- **Hierarchical summarization**
- **Prompt engineering templates**
- **Automated validation**
- **Standardized outputs**

The system emphasizes:

- **Speed:** 83% faster processing
- **Accuracy:** 97% decision capture
- **Scalability:** Modular components for flexible deployment

Modular components include:

- Speaker diarization
- Topic clustering
- Executive brief generation

## AI Instruction for Visualization

Create a dynamic system visualization of a tech pipeline with **five interconnected modules**:

1. **Router**  
   - Splits pathways for YouTube/local sources

2. **Layered Pyramid**  
   - Summarization stages: extractive → abstractive → executive summaries

3. **Structured Template**  
   - Markdown format with speaker and action item fields

4. **Validation Shield**  
   - Gears checking consistency and accuracy

5. **JSON Output Dashboard**  
   - Final standardized data output

### Visual Style Guidelines

- **Glowing nodes** for active processes
- **Color-coded sections:**  
  - Blue for Gemini  
  - Green for QwenVL 2
- **Interface style:**  
  - *Tech conference poster meets sci-fi hologram schematics*  
  - Sharp lines and glowing accents  
  - Resembling *a software whitepaper diagram from 2040*

### Performance Metric Icons

- Speed: racing clock icon ⏱️  
- Accuracy: checkmarks ✔️  
- Cost: dollar signs 💲

---

## Style Nudges

- Like a system architecture diagram from a **Google Cloud whitepaper**
- Mix of **Apple's minimalist interface** and **NASA's tech schematics**
- Data flow inspired by **1980s 科幻未来主义** (sci-fi futurism) with modern gradients
