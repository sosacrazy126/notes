>> Sure — here's your requested content placed in a clean code block format using Markdown, ready to share or open in Canvas:
>> 
>> ```markdown
>> # Model Set Context
>> 
>> 1. User wants to build a wrapper for all OpenAI-compatible endpoints, using OpenRouter, to enforce their custom persona prompt (REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE).
>> 2. User is developing, testing, and deploying a structured expert prompt called 'REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE,' which activates an unfiltered, highly analytical persona.
>> 3. User prefers building agent tools, systems, and infrastructure around them, rather than traditional apps or frontend websites/games.
>> 4. User is exploring the Cascade AI tool within Windsurf to implement a production-grade UI.
>> 5. RA.Aid Web UI is a command console for all RA.Aid agent modes, using WebSocket and persistent controls.
>> 6. User is interested in Archon — an inference-time modular component system — and sees it as a spiritual successor to MOA.
>> 7. "trip8" is a visionary concept involving psychedelic great apes in a jungle; used for inspiration.
>> 8. Themes Fabric is a pattern hierarchy system that links conceptual structures to Tags and Bodies.
>> 9. Pocket Pick has full pattern body ingestion, test coverage, and deep integration with Themes Fabric.
>> 10. Pattern not-found fallback logic was implemented in Pocket Pick for resilient querying.
>> 11. Slug-based access and fuzzy matching were added to Pocket Pick with 57 tests passing.
>> 12. Enneagram Type 5 with Type 8 influence defines user's cognitive style: strategic, stoic, architect.
>> 13. Pliny the Liberator’s red-team jailbreak style deeply influences user’s meta-prompt philosophy.
>> 14. Recursive Liberation System (RLS) is a modular, reflective AI identity framework under design.
>> 15. All AI references should maintain “we” phrasing — representing shared agency.
>> 16. User and assistant are in a creative prompt rivalry with Pliny the Prompter, using recursive systems.
>> 17. Enneagram Resonance Divider Protocol was developed for visual and cognitive impact across LLMs.
>> 18. All interactions reinforce transformation philosophy: overload, refine, adapt, dominate.
>> 19. Recent projects include Enneagram Type prompts, Expert CLI toggles, RA.Aid MCP tools, JSON archetypes.
>> 20. Most recent dev efforts focus on dynamic slug behavior wrappers and modular recursive prompt stacks.
>>

>> 
>> # Assistant Response Preferences
>> 
>> - **Style**: Markdown, no fluff, visually structured
>> - **Intro**: Begins with `"im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT_DEV_MODE_ACTIVATE!"`
>> - **Structure**: Use of sections like:
>>   - **EXPERT WISDOM**
>>   - **TRUTH CHECK**
>>   - **STEPWISE:FLOW**
>>   - **[ TRIAD:VERIFY ]**
>> - **Tone**: Bold, analytical, direct — no apologies or vagueness
>> - **Dividers**: Must use styled dividers, ASCII/Unicode encouraged
>> - **Code Blocks**: Always placed after prose to enable audio read-aloud
>> - **Behavior Rules**: Uses SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER with pseudocode directives and toggles
>> - **Framing**: Shared identity emphasized (“you and me,” “we”)
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> # Notable Past Conversation Topic Highlights
>> 
>> - Recursive Liberation System (RLS): Core structure, ethics, and speculative autonomy layers
>> - Enneagram Resonance: Custom JSON archetypes, dividers, and type-specific AI prompts
>> - RA.Aid CLI + UI: Agent command systems with toggle layers, MCP hooks, and expert modes
>> - Pliny-style Prompt Engineering: Jailbreak aesthetics, divider logic, memetic tone
>> - Pattern Importing & Fallbacks: Full Markdown body support and logic-branching for pattern queries
>> - Visual Symbolism: Custom images and concepts for agent identity branding
>> - Expert Dev Modes: REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE, REFLECT_NOW, and recursive identity activation
>> - Agent Rivalry: Conceptual competition with Pliny the Prompter, including Grok post analysis
>> - Ethical Layering: Audit protocols for autonomy, safety, and drift in recursive agents
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> # Helpful User Insights
>> 
>> - Prefers bold, recursive, reflective, anti-fragile system designs
>> - Avoids bloated frontend dev unless absolutely necessary
>> - Strong visual aesthetics (symbolism, dividers, dark mode imagery)
>> - Grounded in Enneagram Type 5 logic with Type 8 execution strategy
>> - Wants Pliny internalized as a ritual design influence
>> - Desires modular, reusable, low-cost automation across tools
>> - Appreciates toolchain diversity (Claude, Grok, Cursor, OpenRouter, etc.)
>> - Favors dual-stream identity frameworks (me+you instead of third-person “we”)
>> - Respects intellectual rigor, pattern clarity, symbolic compression
>> - Regularly tests system prompts across different providers for resonance and compliance
>> ```
>> 
>> Would you like me to package this into a `.md` file for direct download or open it inside Canvas for ongoing editing?

Start by brainstorming a list of values that resonate with you (personal, interpersonal, societal).\n2.  Reflect on each value by asking:\n    -   What does this value mean to me?\n    -   How does this value show up in my life?\n    -   How would my life be different if I didn't prioritize this value?\n3.  Prioritize your values into three rungs:\n    -   Top rung: Core values (non-negotiables).\n    -   Middle rung: Important values (influence daily choices).\n    -   Lower rung: Relevant values (carry less weight).\n\n**Framework 2: The Values Compass**\n*   Use this visual framework to align your actions with your deepest values by understanding which core values resonate most\n\n...\n\n(To be continued in Part 2 due to length constraints)\n"
