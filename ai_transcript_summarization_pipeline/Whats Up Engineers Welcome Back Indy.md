# Summary of "what's up Engineers welcome back Indy"

This video by Indy Dev Dan explores a practical framework for categorizing large language model (LLM) use cases in the generative AI ecosystem. It aims to help engineers and AI practitioners understand different prompt types, select appropriate tooling, and design effective AI agents and workflows. The framework breaks down LLM applications into six categories, providing examples and insights for each, with a focus on improving prompt engineering and accelerating generative AI development.

## Introduction and Context

**[00:00]**  
- Overview of the rapid pace of generative AI development and recent model releases (OpenAI, Microsoft, Gemini 2, LLaMA 3.3).  
- Motivation to share a **large language model use case framework** to help navigate new models and tools.

## The Six Categories of LLM Use Cases

### 1. Expansion Prompts

**[02:10]**  
- Generate content, explanations, ideas, or learning material from small inputs.  
- Examples: content generation, story writing, code generation, documentation.  
- Models demonstrated: Gemini 2.0 Flash, LLaMA 3.3, 54 (14B parameter model).  
- *Key takeaway:* Expansion prompts turn brief queries into detailed outputs.

### 2. Compression Prompts

**[07:05]**  
- Opposite of expansion: distill large inputs into concise summaries or key points.  
- Use cases: summarization, meeting notes, extracting essential information.  
- Models used to demonstrate summarization capabilities.  
- *Key takeaway:* Compression prompts enable faster learning by condensing information.

### 3. Conversion Prompts

**[08:22]**  
- Convert information from one format to another (e.g., text to SQL, TypeScript to Python, language translation).  
- Example: converting natural language queries into SQL statements.  
- *Key takeaway:* Conversion prompts transfer core information across formats efficiently.

### 4. Seeker Prompts

**[09:28]**  
- Extract specific information from data or documents.  
- Applications: codebase Q&A, support chatbots, document search, OCR data extraction.  
- Example: finding the best performing product in a sales report.  
- *Key takeaway:* Seeker prompts focus on pinpointing exact answers rather than summarizing.

### 5. Action Prompts

**[11:23]**  
- Execute commands or tool calls with concrete side effects (e.g., git commands).  
- Can be manual or automated tool calls, including JSON parsing and function execution.  
- *Key takeaway:* Action prompts enable LLMs to interact with and control real-world systems.

### 6. Reasoning Prompts

**[12:42]**  
- Provide judgments, insights, and decision-making support based on complex inputs.  
- Use cases: planning, risk assessment, recommendations, threat analysis.  
- Example: evaluating authentication methods for a web app.  
- *Key takeaway:* Reasoning prompts help LLMs make informed decisions and guide workflows.

## Importance of Categorization

**[03:41] - [04:59]**  
- Categorizing prompts improves prompt engineering by clarifying tooling and syntax needs.  
- Enables creation of reusable benchmarks tailored to each prompt type.  
- Facilitates design of **agentic workflows** by chaining prompt categories (e.g., Seeker → Reasoning → Action).  
- Simplifies building AI agents that operate autonomously and efficiently.

---

## Practical Applications and Benefits

**[15:01] - [16:56]**  
- Categorization narrows down engineering approaches and tooling for each use case.  
- Helps reuse tooling and benchmarks within categories, increasing efficiency.  
- Supports systematic and scalable generative AI engineering.  
- Enables faster, better decision-making and AI agent design.

## Conclusion and Call to Action

**[18:02] - [19:07]**  
- The six categories—Expansion, Compression, Conversion, Seeker, Action, and Reasoning—form a simple yet powerful framework for LLM use cases.  
- This framework aids in navigating the fast-evolving generative AI landscape and building effective AI tools and agents.  
- Viewers are encouraged to share feedback on the categorization and engage with the channel for more insights.  
- Emphasis on the importance of categorization to leverage new AI models and releases effectively.

# Final Takeaway

This video presents a **clear, actionable framework** for understanding and engineering with large language models by categorizing prompts into six distinct types. This approach enhances prompt design, tooling selection, and AI agent development, empowering engineers to build smarter, more efficient generative AI systems.
