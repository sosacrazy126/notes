### User, on 05/01/2025 at 10:09 AM;
> im using the claude proxy and guess what we got  test_project_info.py\n    - test_project_state.py\n  - uv.lock\n</context>\n<context name=\"gitStatus\">This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.\nCurrent branch: master\n\nMain branch (you will usually use this for PRs): master\n\nStatus:\n(clean)\n\nRecent commits:\nf5bc8b1 Merge pull request #221 from pztrick/fix/web-ui-copy-and-scroll\n16a2840 Merge pull request #219 from pztrick/fix/mcp-tool-params-null\n21cd7ce updates prebuilt assets\n21d728e feat: adds Refresh icon at top-right to indicate auto-scrolling behavior\nace14a0 fix copy/paste for Task Specification trajectory component</context>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "hi "}], "max_tokens": 20000, "stream": true, "temperature": 1.0, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Task", "description": "Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Batch, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoRead, TodoWrite. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.\n\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\n- If you are searching for a keyword like \"config\" or \"logger\", or for questions like \"which file does X?\", the Agent tool is strongly recommended\n\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"description": {"type": "string", "description": "A short (3-5 word) description of the task"}, "prompt": {"type": "string", "description": "The task for the agent to perform"}}, "required": ["description", "prompt"], "additionalProperties": false, "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}}}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Bash", "description": "Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Use Batch to run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message. Wrap your analysis process in <commit_analysis> tags:\n\n<commit_analysis>\n- List the files that have been changed or added\n- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)\n- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes\n- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project\n- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n- Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point\n- Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.)\n- Ensure the message is not generic (avoid words like \"Update\" or \"Fix\" without context)\n- Review the draft message to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n</commit_analysis>\n\n3. Use Batch to run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Use the git context at the start of this conversation to determine which files are relevant to your commit. Be careful not to stage and commit files (e.g. with `git add .`) that aren't relevant to your commit.\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- Ensure your commit message is meaningful and concise. It should explain the purpose of the changes, not just describe them.\n- Return an empty response - the user will see the git output directly\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Use Batch to run the following commands in parallel, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary. Wrap your analysis process in <pr_analysis> tags:\n\n<pr_analysis>\n- List the commits since diverging from the main branch\n- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)\n- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes\n- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project\n- Do not use tools to explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n- Draft a concise (1-2 bullet points) pull request summary that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n- Ensure the summary accurately reflects all changes since diverging from the main branch\n- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point\n- Ensure the summary accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (ie. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.)\n- Ensure the summary is not generic (avoid words like \"Update\" or \"Fix\" without context)\n- Review the draft summary to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n</pr_analysis>\n\n3. Use Batch to run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "description": "The command to execute"}, "timeout": {"type": "number", "description": "Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)"}, "description": {"type": "string", "description": " Clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.

>> 😎 Looks like you're running with the Claude proxy now — and the repo's looking *real clean* (`git status: clean`, branch: `master`). You've also got some test files in play like `test_project_info.py` and `test_project_state.py`, plus a `uv.lock` file showing `uv` is managing Python deps.
>> 
>> 💡 **Takeaway:** You're set up for fast iterations. All commits are merged, branch is synced, and you're ready to fire off tests, edits, or new features without conflicts.
>> 
>> Need help triggering tests, editing any of those files, or committing new logic?

<!-- UID: aa6f1302-18f2-4a45-821a-441add177fa9 -->


#### ChatGPT, on 05/01/2025 at 10:10 AM;
>> Got it — you're seeing internal Claude Code usage logs from a proxy-based setup (like [claude-proxy](https://github.com/j178/claude-proxy) or something similar), and it’s showing requests/responses from test files and tool executions (e.g., `test_project_info.py`, `test_project_state.py`, `uv.lock`, git context, etc.).
>> 
>> ### 🔍 What This Means
>> 
>> You're looking at structured context injection and tool call outputs that are part of the Anthropic Claude API's *Code Interpreter / Tool-using Mode*. The tool definitions (`Task`, `Bash`, `Batch`, etc.) and extended metadata (e.g., `<context name="gitStatus">`, `<commit_analysis>`) are how the Claude system internally orchestrates tool use, especially during coding assistance.
>> 
>> This confirms:
>> - You're getting full Claude Code functionality — tool usage like Bash commands, multi-agent invocation, file editing, Git operations, etc.
>> - The proxy is correctly injecting file and Git context at runtime (very useful for coding workflows).
>> - The recent commits (`f5bc8b1`, `16a2840`, etc.) show you're working in an active repo and can benefit from contextual PRs, test debugging, and structured tool orchestration.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🛠️ What You Can Do with This
>> 
>> With this setup, you're basically running **Claude with tool use powered by a local proxy**, meaning you can:
>> 
>> 1. **Run agents** for tasks like searching files, editing, testing, and orchestrating tasks.
>> 2. **Auto-draft commits** with rich contextual awareness (`git diff`, `git status`, `git log` analysis).
>> 3. **Integrate directly with your workflow** — it mirrors what Anthropic provides on Claude.ai/code but locally.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 💡 Tip
>> 
>> If you’re logging all this to debug or enhance usage, you might consider:
>> - Adding `tool usage summaries` (e.g., agent task results or errors).
>> - Filtering verbose context when not debugging.
>> - Injecting custom tools into the proxy setup if you're modifying `claude-proxy`.
>> 
>> Would you like help writing a custom agent function or enhancing the proxy toolset (e.g., adding a file uploader or git diff viewer)?

>> Claude's ability to interact with external tools is facilitated through its function calling mechanism. This allows Claude to perform tasks beyond its initial training by integrating with user-defined tools. The process involves:
>> 
>> 1. **Defining Tools**: Specify tools with names, descriptions, and input schemas in your API request.
>> 2. **Tool Invocation**: Claude assesses if any tools can assist with the user's query and constructs a tool use request accordingly.
>> 3. **Execution and Response**: Extract the tool name and input from Claude’s request, execute the tool client-side, and return the results to Claude for formulating a final response. citeturn0search0

>> ### 🔍 Understanding Claude's Tool Ecosystem
>> 
>> Claude can interact with external tools via its API. When a user prompt requires a tool, Claude constructs a request, which your system executes, and then returns the results back to Claude citeturn0search4.
>> 
>> To manage tool permissions, Claude uses configuration files:
>> 
>> - `~/.claude.json` for personal project settings
>> - `.claude/settings.json` for shared project settings
>> - `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/policies.json` (macOS) or `/etc/claude-code/policies.json` (Linux/WSL) for organization-wide policies citeturn0search0.
>> 
>> These configurations allow you to define which tools are allowed or denied, specifying commands or patterns (e.g., `"Bash(npm run test:*)"`).
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧩 Replicating Claude's Behavior with a Proxy
>> 
>> You can create a custom proxy to emulate Claude's tool usage:
>> 
>> - **Proxy Setup**: Implement a FastAPI server that translates Claude's API requests into actions.
>> - **Logging**: Capture detailed request and response logs to analyze tool usage patterns.
>> - **Mapping**: Translate Claude's tool calls into equivalent actions in your environment.
>> - **Output Protocol**: Ensure your proxy returns results in a format compatible with Claude's expectations citeturn0search3.
>> 
>> This approach allows you to observe and replicate Claude's interactions with tools, providing insights into its ecosystem.
