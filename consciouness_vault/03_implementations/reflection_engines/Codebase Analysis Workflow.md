# Codebase Analysis Workflow

## Phase 1: Initial Code Ingestion and Parsing

**Description**: Initial Code Ingestion and Parsing.

### Techniques

- **Lexical Analysis and Parsing**
  - **Description**: Breaking down source code into tokens and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the code's structure.
  - **Artifacts**: AST, Token Stream.

- **Static Code Analysis**
  - **Description**: Analyzing code without execution to identify potential issues, dependencies, and code patterns.
  - **Artifacts**: Dependency graphs, Control flow graphs, Code metrics.

- **File System Traversal**
  - **Description**: Recursively exploring the codebase directory structure to identify files and their relationships.
  - **Artifacts**: File lists, Directory structures.

**Next Phase**: 2

## Phase 2: Semantic Understanding and Relationship Extraction

**Description**: Semantic Understanding and Relationship Extraction.

### Techniques

- **Symbol Table Construction**
  - **Description**: Creating a table of identifiers (variables, functions, classes) and their properties to understand their scope and usage.
  - **Artifacts**: Symbol tables, Scope information.

- **Control Flow Analysis**
  - **Description**: Analyzing how the program's execution flow is determined by conditionals and loops.
  - **Artifacts**: Control flow graphs, Dominance trees.

- **Data Flow Analysis**
  - **Description**: Tracking how data moves through the program, identifying variable dependencies and potential data flow anomalies.
  - **Artifacts**: Data flow graphs, Variable usage information.

- **Graph Representation**
  - **Description**: Constructing a graph representation of the codebase, where nodes are code elements and edges represent relationships (e.g., function calls, inheritance).
  - **Artifacts**: Code graphs, Dependency graphs.

- **Vector Embeddings**
  - **Description**: Generating numerical representations (embeddings) of code snippets and files to enable semantic similarity searches and relationship discovery.
  - **Artifacts**: Vector embeddings.

**Next Phase**: 3

## Phase 3: Contextual Understanding and Language Model Integration

**Description**: Contextual Understanding and Language Model Integration.

### Techniques

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**
  - **Description**: Utilizing LLMs to understand natural language queries and generate code or explanations based on the codebase context.
  - **Artifacts**: Generated code, Natural language explanations.

- **Contextual Reasoning**
  - **Description**: Combining information from the AST, graph representation, and vector embeddings to understand the relationships between different parts of the code and the user's query.
  - **Artifacts**: Contextualized code information, Query resolutions.

- **Semantic Search**
  - **Description**: Using vector embeddings to find code snippets and files that are semantically related to the user's query.
  - **Artifacts**: Relevant code snippets, Related files.

**Next Phase**: None
