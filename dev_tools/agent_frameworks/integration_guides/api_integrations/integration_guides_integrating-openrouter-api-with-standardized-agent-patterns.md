# OVERVIEW  
What It Does: Integrates OpenRouter API into a system via standardized agent patterns, enabling use of LLM models with error handling and configuration options.  
Why People Use It: Provides consistent access to multiple models through OpenRouter with robust error handling and configurable parameters.  

# HOW TO USE IT  
Most Common Syntax:  
```python  
from core.agents.factory import get_architect_for_phase  
architect = get_architect_for_phase(provider="OPENROUTER", config="OPENROUTER_GEMINI_FREE")  
```  

# COMMON USE CASES  
For Initializing the Architect:  
```python  
get_architect_for_phase(provider="OPENROUTER")  
```  
For Running Analysis with a Specific Model:  
```python  
architect.analyze(query="...", model_config="OPENROUTER_CREATIVE")  
```  
For Handling API Errors Gracefully:  
```python  
try:  
    architect.synthesize_findings(data)  
except APIError as e:  
    logging.error("API failed: %s", e)  
```  
For Testing Integration:  
```bash  
python tests/openrouter/run_openrouter_test.py  
```  
For Using Custom Headers:  
```python  
architect._api_call(headers={"X-Custom-Key": "value"})  
```  

# MOST IMPORTANT AND USED OPTIONS AND FEATURES  
- **ModelProvider enum**: Standardizes provider references in code (e.g., `OPENROUTER`).  
- **Error handling**: Try/except blocks and logging in all critical methods prevent crashes.  
- **Model configurations**: Predefined configs like `OPENROUTER_GEMINI_FREE` simplify parameter setup.  
- **API key validation**: Enforces presence of `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with clear error messages.  
- **Factory function integration**: `get_architect_for_phase()` auto-selects OpenRouterArchitect when provider is specified.  
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Reverts to direct requests if OpenAI SDK fails, ensuring reliability.  
- **Custom headers support**: Allows passing OpenRouter-specific parameters for advanced use cases.  
- **Testing scripts**: `run_openrouter_test.py` provides quick validation of functionality.
