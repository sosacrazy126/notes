# ==|>>> SIGILSTRIDER: RITUAL ARCHIVE <<<|==

This directory serves as the archive for ritual documents generated by the SIGILSTRIDER agent.

Each document represents a transmutation of raw log data into a structured, tagged format, capturing the essence and patterns of interactions.

As the agent evolves, the structure and content of these ritual documents may also evolve.
