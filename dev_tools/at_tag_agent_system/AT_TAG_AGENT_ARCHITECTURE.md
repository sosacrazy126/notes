# @ Tag Agent Architecture - Living Pattern System

**Primary Directive**: "Patterns as Agents | Auto-Learning | Recursive Enhancement"

Transform the @ tag system into autonomous, callable agents with YAML frontmatter, auto-activation, and collaborative capabilities.

## Core Agent Framework

### @ Tag Agent Template

```yaml
---
tag: "@pattern_name()"
category: "domain/subcategory" 
purpose: "What this pattern does and when to use it"
auto-activation: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "pattern context"]
performance-profile: "optimization|exploration|implementation"
origin: "Source pattern â†’ evolved capability"
collaboration: ["@related_pattern1()", "@related_pattern2()"]
---
```

### Agent Capabilities Structure

```yaml
agent_definition:
  identity: "Role and specialization focus"
  priority_hierarchy: "primary > secondary > tertiary priorities"
  core_principles:
    - "Fundamental operating principle 1"
    - "Fundamental operating principle 2" 
    - "Fundamental operating principle 3"
  
  cognitive_integration:
    pattern_recognition: "How it identifies relevant contexts"
    knowledge_synthesis: "How it combines information"
    auto_learning: "How it improves from usage"
  
  activation_triggers:
    keywords: ["trigger_word1", "trigger_word2"]
    contexts: ["context_type1", "context_type2"]
    patterns: ["related_pattern1", "related_pattern2"]
  
  collaboration_patterns:
    primary_partners: ["@agent1()", "@agent2()"]
    expertise_sharing: "What knowledge it provides to others"
    delegation_rules: "When to hand off to other agents"
```

  user_feedback: "Direct suggestions for new pattern needs"
```

### Agent Evolution Framework
```yaml

```

## Collaborative Intelligence Patterns

### Agent Orchestration
```yaml
orchestration_modes:

coordination_mechanisms:
  message_passing: "Agents share information and results"
  shared_memory: "Common knowledge space for collaboration"
  event_system: "Agents respond to system-wide events"
  delegation_chains: "Agents hand off tasks to specialists"
```

### Cross-Agent Learning
```yaml
learning_patterns:
  expertise_sharing: "Agents teach their specializations to others"
  pattern_transfer: "Successful patterns spread across agent types"
  collaborative_reasoning: "Agents combine perspectives for better solutions"
  collective_memory: "Shared learning experiences benefit all agents"
```
