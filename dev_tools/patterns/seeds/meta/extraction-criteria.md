# Seed Extraction Criteria

## The SEED Test
Every piece of information must pass ALL four criteria:

### S - **Standalone**
- Can be understood without extensive context
- Self-contained concept
- Clear boundaries

### E - **Essential**
- Provides fundamental value
- Not derivative or redundant
- Core to understanding

### E - **Enduring**
- Remains valid over time
- Not tied to temporary circumstances
- Principles over implementations

### D - **Deployable**
- Can be applied in practice
- Enables decisions or actions
- Clear use cases

## Quality Metrics

### High-Value Seeds
- **Universal**: Applies across multiple contexts
- **Generative**: Spawns new insights when combined
- **Clarifying**: Reduces complexity, increases understanding

### Low-Value Noise
- **Temporary**: Time-bound information
- **Derivative**: Can be inferred from other seeds
- **Verbose**: Uses many words to say little
- **Context-Heavy**: Requires extensive explanation

## Extraction Process

1. **Identify Candidate**
   - What is the core insight?
   - Strip away all non-essential context

2. **Apply SEED Test**
   - Score each criterion (Pass/Fail)
   - All must pass to qualify

3. **Distill to Essence**
   - Remove redundancy
   - Simplify language
   - Focus on the "why"

4. **Validate Connections**
   - How does it relate to existing seeds?
   - Does it duplicate or extend?

## Red Flags (Noise Indicators)
- ðŸš« "In this specific case..."
- ðŸš« "As of [date]..."
- ðŸš« "According to [specific source]..."
- ðŸš« Lengthy explanations
- ðŸš« Implementation details without principles
- ðŸš« Personal anecdotes without universal lessons

## Green Flags (Seed Indicators)
- âœ… "The principle is..."
- âœ… "This pattern appears when..."
- âœ… "The core insight is..."
- âœ… Clear cause-effect relationships
- âœ… Timeless wisdom
- âœ… Applicable across domains
