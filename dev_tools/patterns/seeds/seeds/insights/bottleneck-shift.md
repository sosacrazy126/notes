# Bottleneck Shift

> [!NOTE]
> The limitation in AI-assisted development has shifted from model capabilities to human imagination and communication skills.

## Key Insight
Modern AI models (O1, Claude 3.5) are no longer the bottleneckâ€”our ability to communicate **what** we want done is. The constraint is now our planning and prompting skills.

### Applications
- Invest in planning and specification skills.
- Practice thinking in terms of **what** to build, not **how** to build it.
- Scale your ambitions to match the capabilities of modern models.
- Recognize that 1000+ line code generations are now possible.

### Example
```plaintext
Old Bottleneck: "Can the AI understand this complex task?"
New Bottleneck: "Can I explain this complex task clearly?"
```
