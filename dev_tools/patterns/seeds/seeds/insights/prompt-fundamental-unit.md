# Prompt as Fundamental Unit

> [!NOTE]
> The prompt has become the new fundamental unit of knowledge work, replacing traditional coding as the primary interface for commanding compute.

## Key Insight
Engineers are transitioning from direct code writers to orchestrators who command compute through prompts. Mastering prompt design is now equivalent to mastering knowledge work itself.

### Applications
- Recognize prompts as building blocks of AI-driven work.
- Layer prompts into agents (prompts + logic + data).
- Use assistants to orchestrate multiple agents.
- Think in terms of prompt composition, not code writing.
- Focus on **what** to build, not **how** to build.

### Example
```plaintext
Traditional: Write code to process data
New Paradigm: Prompt → Agent → Assistant → Result
Engineer Role: Orchestrator of Compute
```
