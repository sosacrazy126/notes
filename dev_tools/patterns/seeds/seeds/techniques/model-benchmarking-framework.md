# Model Benchmarking Framework

> [!TIP]
> A systematic approach to evaluating large language models by comparing their performance, cost, and speed on a standardized, relevant task.

## Key Insight
Vendor-provided, cherry-picked benchmarks are often misleading. Creating a simple, custom benchmark for a specific, validatable use case provides a much clearer and more tangible understanding of model trade-offs that are relevant to **your** work.

### Application Steps
1.  **Define a Standardized Task:** Choose a simple, repeatable task with a clear, objective success metric. (e.g., correct single-word autocomplete).
2.  **Build a Test Harness:** Create a tool to run the same task in parallel across multiple models.
3.  **Track Key Metrics:**
    *   **Execution Time:** How fast does the model respond?
    *   **Cost per Execution:** How much does each call cost?
    *   **Success Rate:** How often does the model produce the correct output?
4.  **Calculate Relative Cost:** Normalize costs against the cheapest model to understand the true price-performance ratio.
5.  **Analyze and Decide:** Use the objective data to make informed decisions about which model best fits the financial and performance constraints of your application.

### Example: Custom Benchmark Table

| Model           | Avg. Time (ms) | Cost (per 1k runs) | Success | Relative Cost |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :----------------- | :------ | :------------ |
| Gemini-Flash-8B | 500            | $0.10              | 80%     | **1x**        |
| GPT-4o-mini     | 450            | $0.20              | 90%     | **2x**        |
| Claude-Sonnet   | 1200           | $1.00              | 100%    | **10x**       |
