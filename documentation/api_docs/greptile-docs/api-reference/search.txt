Submit a natural language query about the codebase, get a list of relevant code references (filepaths, line numbers, etc).

*Examples*

1. "Code to provision new API keys"
2. "Functions that use recursion"
3. "Code that touches session management in any way"

Note: Before Greptile can search a repo, it must be indexed. See [Index Repository](/api-reference/index) for more information.
