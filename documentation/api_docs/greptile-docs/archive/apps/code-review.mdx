### Why is it useful?

Greptile's code review bot writes comments that:

- Summarize the changes with codebase context, making it far easier for a human reviewer to contextualize and parse the changes.
- Are context-aware, so can discuss the implications of the changes to the wider codebase.
- Can identify potential performance,security or compliance issues produced by the changes.
- Reference similar code or abstractions related to the changes that are already in the codebase, to prevent repitition.
- Enforces your custom style guide and prescribed patterns.

This means:
1. Less time spent reviewing PRs or awaiting review, and more time spent writing code.
2. More bugs caught that humans might miss.
3. A human reviewer can focus on the "big picture" and "strategic" aspects of the changes, while the bot can focus on the "tactical" aspects.

### Installation

Click [here](https://app.greptile.com/login) to install the PR Review bot.

### Trigger

By default, Greptile reviews every new PR when it is first opened or when a user comments `@greptileai` on the PR. It can also be configured to review PRs on certain triggers.
- Trigger only on new PRs withcertain labels.
- Trigger on all new commits pushed to a PR branch.
- Do not trigger on PRs with a certain label or containing some specific keyword in the title or description.

### Conversation

You can ask Greptile for fix suggestions or ask follow up questions by replying to its comments in format `@greptileai <your question>`.

### Reinforcement Learning

Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with `üëç` or `üëé` to its comments.

### Customization

You can customize the bot's behavior by providing "special instructions" for the bot to follow, for example, "Include a section on compliance implications of the changes in the PR."

You can also customize the bot's behavior by selecting certain criterion for the bot to evaluate each diff on, for example syntax issues, or style guide violations.

### Per-repo config and patterns repos with `greptile.json`

You can have custom settings for any repo by adding a `greptile.json` file to the root of the repo in your default branch. 
You can grab your global settings in the correct format [here](https://app.greptile.com/login) by clicking on the `copy` or `download` icons on the top right of the Settings panel. 
Note: The `ignorePatterns` field follows `.gitignore` [syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

```json greptile.json
{
  "labels": [
    "feature",
    "bug"
  ],
  "comment": "Disclaimer: This is AI-generated.",
  "commentTypes": [
    "logic",
    "syntax"
  ],
  "instructions": "Ensure style_guide.md is enforced.",
  "ignoreKeywords": "rename\nlinter\nprettier\ngreptile-ignor",
  "ignorePatterns": "testing/**/*.py\n*.md\n*.txt\n*.json",
  "patternRepositories": ["acme/backend"],
  "triggerOnUpdates": true,
  "shouldUpdateDescription": false,
  "disabledLabels": [
    "docs"
  ],
  "includeAuthors": [
    "dakshgup",
    "schoi"
  ],
  "excludeAuthors": [
    "cool-dev"
  ]
}
```

**Patterns repos**

In the `greptile.json` file, you can specify a `patternsRepo` field with repos related to the one being reviewed that might add helpful context. 
An example is adding a frontend repo to a backend repo's `greptile.json` file so that the bot can reference frontend code when reviewing backend code.
