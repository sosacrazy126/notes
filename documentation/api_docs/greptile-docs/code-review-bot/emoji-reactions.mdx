## Emoji Reactions

You can respond with a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji to indicate whether you agree with the comment or not. Greptile will use your feedback to improve future comments.

| Emoji     | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 👍        | This is a good comment, make more comments like this! |
| 👎        | This is a bad comment, don't make more comments like this! |

If you respond with a thumbs down, it is helpful to also reply to Greptile telling it why it's wrong. This also helps Greptile gain more context and improves future comments.
