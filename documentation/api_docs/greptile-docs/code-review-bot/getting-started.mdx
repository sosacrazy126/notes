### What does Greptile comment on?

Greptile comments on many types of bugs, antipatterns and style violations out-of-the-box, and can be configured to enforce your custom rules. 

You can think of Greptile as a stack-agnostic, AI-powered linter.

<Card title="Logic" icon="lightbulb" horizontal> 
    Surfaces logical errors by inferring the intent of the change and scanning related files, imports, and more.
</Card>

<Card title="Style" icon="code" horizontal> 
    Enforces stack-specific best practices as well as your custom style guide and patterns.
</Card>

<Card title="Performance" icon="gauge-high" horizontal>
    Identifies potential performance issues by analyzing the impact of the changes on the codebase.
</Card>

<Card title="Security" icon="shield" horizontal>
    Identifies potential security issues by analyzing the impact of the changes on the codebase.
</Card>

<Card title="Compliance" icon="list-check" horizontal>
    Enforces your custom compliance rules and regulations.
</Card>

<Card title="Code Repetition" icon="copy" horizontal>
    Identifies potential code repetition by scanning the codebase for similar code.
</Card>


### Why is it useful?

Greptile's code review bot writes comments that:

- Are context-aware, so can discuss the implications of the changes to the wider codebase.
- Can identify potential performance,security or compliance issues produced by the changes.
- Reference similar code or abstractions related to the changes that are already in the codebase, to prevent repitition.
- Enforces your custom style guide and prescribed patterns.

This means:
1. Less time spent reviewing PRs or awaiting review, and more time spent writing code.
2. More bugs caught that humans might miss.
3. A human reviewer can focus on the "big picture" and "strategic" aspects of the changes, while the bot can focus on the "tactical" aspects.
