| Filter By | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `labels`  | Include or exclude PRs with specific labels |
| `branches` | Include or exclude PRs to or from specific branches |
| `author` | Include or exclude PRs based on PR author |
| `keywords` | Include or exclude PRs containing a specific keyword in the title, description,or last commit message |


### Trigger Manually

You can trigger Greptile to review a PR manually by commenting `@greptileai` on the PR.
