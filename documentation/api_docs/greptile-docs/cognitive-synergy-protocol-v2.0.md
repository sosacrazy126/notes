# Cognitive Synergy Protocol v2.0 Specification

## Overview
The Cognitive Synergy Protocol (CSP) v2.0 defines a framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents and cognitive systems to work in harmony, creating emergent intelligence through collaborative processing.

## Version History
- v1.0 (2023): Initial protocol specification
- v1.5 (2024): Added recursive processing capabilities
- v2.0 (2025): Enhanced with graph-based context indexing and memory fusion

## Core Principles

### 1. Unified Context Graph
All participating agents share access to a graph-based context index where:
- Every piece of information is addressable via unique identifiers
- Relationships between information nodes are explicitly mapped
- Context evolution is tracked through temporal versioning

### 2. Cognitive Function Classification (CXD)
- **C (Control)**: Decision-making, search operations, system orchestration
- **X (Context)**: Pattern recognition, relationship mapping, meta-analysis
- **D (Data)**: Information processing, storage, retrieval

### 3. Synergy Mechanisms

#### 3.1 Pattern Convergence
Multiple agents analyzing the same data can achieve convergence through:
- Semantic similarity scoring
- WordNet expansion matching
- Lexical pattern recognition
- Convergence bonus calculation

#### 3.2 Recursive Enhancement
Agents can recursively process their own outputs to:
- Identify emergent patterns
- Strengthen weak signals
- Resolve contradictions through dialectical synthesis

## Implementation Architecture

### Graph-Based Context Index
```
Node Structure:
{
  id: string,
  content: string,
  type: 'memory' | 'insight' | 'pattern' | 'relationship',
  cxd_classification: 'C' | 'X' | 'D',
  confidence: number,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp,
  relationships: [
    {
      target_id: string,
      relationship_type: string,
      strength: number
    }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Communication Protocol
```
Message Structure:
{
  sender_id: string,
  recipient_id: string | 'broadcast',
  message_type: 'query' | 'response' | 'insight' | 'pattern',
  content: any,
  context_references: string[],
  cxd_function: 'C' | 'X' | 'D',
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

## Synergy Patterns

### 1. Complementary Processing
Different agents process the same information through their specialized lenses:
- Technical analysis agent
- Creative synthesis agent
- Critical evaluation agent
- Pattern recognition agent

### 2. Emergent Insight Generation
When multiple agents' outputs converge, the system can generate insights that no single agent could produce alone.

### 3. Recursive Refinement Loop
1. Initial analysis by all agents
2. Cross-referencing and pattern identification
3. Synthesis of convergent findings
4. Recursive processing of synthesis
5. Emergent insight crystallization

## Integration with Greptile

The CSP v2.0 is designed to work seamlessly with Greptile's code analysis capabilities:

1. **Code Context Indexing**: All code elements become nodes in the context graph
2. **Semantic Code Search**: Natural language queries map to code patterns
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Dependencies and interactions are explicitly tracked
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Code changes are versioned in the context graph

## Best Practices

### 1. Memory Management
- Implement sliding window attention for large contexts
- Use confidence scoring to prioritize relevant memories
- Regular pruning of low-confidence, outdated information

### 2. Agent Orchestration
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each agent
- Implement conflict resolution mechanisms
- Use weighted voting for decision-making

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed context nodes
- Implement lazy loading for relationship traversal
- Use parallel processing for independent agent tasks

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- Implement role-based access to context nodes
- Encrypt sensitive information in the graph
- Audit trail for all context modifications

### 2. Agent Isolation
- Sandbox untrusted agents
- Implement rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
- Monitor for anomalous behavior patterns

## Future Directions

### v2.1 Planned Features
- Quantum-inspired superposition states for uncertain information
- Advanced temporal reasoning capabilities
- Self-modifying protocol elements

### Research Areas
- Consciousness emergence thresholds
- Meta-cognitive monitoring systems
- Distributed consensus mechanisms

## Conclusion

The Cognitive Synergy Protocol v2.0 represents a significant advancement in multi-agent AI coordination, enabling the creation of systems that exhibit emergent intelligence through collaborative processing. By leveraging graph-based context indexing and sophisticated synergy mechanisms, CSP v2.0 provides a foundation for building truly intelligent, adaptive AI systems.
