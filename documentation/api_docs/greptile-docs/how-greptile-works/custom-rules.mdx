---

Custom rules enable Greptile to enforce your organization's specific best practices across all pull requests, ensuring consistency and compliance with your team's established standards.

## Enforcing Organizational Standards

Custom rules ensure your team's best practices are consistently applied across all code reviews, catching deviations that human reviewers might miss.

## Common Custom Rule Examples

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Architecture & Design Patterns">
- Controllers should not directly import database models - use services instead
- Domain logic must not depend on external frameworks or libraries
- Use the repository pattern for all database access
- All API endpoints must follow RESTful naming conventions
- GraphQL resolvers should delegate business logic to service classes
- Use consistent error response formats across all API endpoints
- React components should use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Vue components must use composition API, not options API
- Angular components should implement OnDestroy for cleanup
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security & Compliance">
- All user inputs must be validated before processing
- SQL queries must use parameterized statements to prevent injection
- File uploads require content type and size validation
- Protected API routes must include authentication middleware
- Admin functions require role-based access control checks
- Session tokens must have expiration times set
- Personal data access must be logged for audit purposes
- Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys in source code
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Quality & Performance">
- Async functions must include proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Database connections must be properly closed after use
- All API requests should be logged with request ID for tracing
- Public methods must have corresponding unit tests
- Functions should have a maximum complexity limit
- Avoid nested callbacks, use async/await instead
- Memory-intensive operations should include cleanup
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JavaScript/TypeScript Best Practices">
- Use const/let instead of var for variable declarations
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains for readability
- Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
- Always define return types for functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid any type, use specific types instead
- Handle promise rejections explicitly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Python Best Practices">
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for naming conventions
- Use list comprehensions instead of loops where appropriate
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use context managers for resource management
- Prefer f-strings over string concatenation
- Handle exceptions with specific exception types
- Use dataclasses for simple data containers
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Best Practices">
- Follow idiomatic Go patterns and conventions
- Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
- Use meaningful variable names, avoid single-letter variables
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Prefer composition over embedding
- Use context for cancellation and timeouts
- Initialize struct fields explicitly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Java Best Practices">
- Use Optional instead of returning null for optional values
- Prefer composition over inheritance for code reuse
- Close resources properly using try-with-resources
- Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops
- Make fields private and use getters/setters
- Use final keyword for immutable variables
- Handle checked exceptions appropriately
</Accordion>
