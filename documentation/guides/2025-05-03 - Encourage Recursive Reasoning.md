>> To **stack** and **bend** `Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning` into a repeated, recursively deepening structure — like you're nesting or scaffolding the concept — here's how to approach it symbolically and functionally:
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### ⛓️ Recursive Prompt Stack: "Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning"
>> 
>> #### 🔹**Level 1: Base Directive**
>> ```
>> Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning
>> ```
>> 
>> #### 🔹**Level 2: Meta Directive**
>> > Encourage the agent to reflect on how to **Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning**.
>> 
>> ```
>> Now, explicitly guide the model to explain how and why it would encourage step-by-step reasoning in its own outputs.
>> ```
>> 
>> #### 🔹**Level 3: Meta-Meta Recursive Layer**
>> > Reflect on the benefits and techniques of recursively **encouraging the agent to Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning**, building a *loop of introspective clarity*.
>> 
>> ```
>> Ask the model to evaluate the recursive impact of continually encouraging step-by-step reasoning — and how that might affect coherence, insight generation, and problem-solving reliability.
>> ```
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🌀 Recursive Stack Pattern
>> 
>> You can formalize this recursion in a **stacking syntax** to be used in any prompt-engineering system:
>> 
>> ```
>> vvEncourage Step-by-Step Reasoning
>> vvvvEncourage (meta about encouraging)
>> vvvvvvEncourage (meta-meta about recursive improvement)
>> vvvvvvvvEncourage (hyper-meta reinforcement loop)
>> ```
>> 
>> Each `vv` level deepens the reflection or reinforcement. This can even be translated into a procedural prompting framework:

>> ### 🧠 Procedural Prompt Bending
>> 
>> ```markdown
>> # Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning Protocol
>> 
>> 1. 🔍 **Observe the Problem.** Clearly restate the task before proceeding.
>> 2. 🧩 **Break it into parts.** List each subcomponent.
>> 3. 🪜 **Tackle each part.** Solve one subproblem at a time.
>> 4. 🔄 **Reflect recursively.** Ask: Did each step logically follow? What was assumed?
>> 5. 🧠 **Encourage the Encouragement.** Prompt yourself or the agent to explain the benefit of the method itself.
>> 6. 🔁 **Loop this scaffold.** Apply the entire protocol again to its own output for compounding clarity.
>> ```
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### ✨ Output Format Example
>> 
>> ```markdown
>> ## 🧭 Step-by-Step Breakdown (vvEncourage Mode Activated)
>> 
>> 1. ✅ Step 1: Clarify the objective.
>> 2. ✅ Step 2: Identify possible steps to achieve the objective.
>> 3. ✅ Step 3: Walk through each step methodically.
>> 4. ✅ Step 4: Reflect on how this breakdown improves clarity.
>> 5. 🧠 Meta: Explain how breaking it down made reasoning more robust.
>> 6. 🌀 Recursive Boost: Now encourage yourself to reinforce this method again.
>> ```

>> Would you like this turned into a reusable macro prompt or injected into one of your system prompt frameworks like `REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE` or `{{INDYDEVDAN_PERSONA}}`?
