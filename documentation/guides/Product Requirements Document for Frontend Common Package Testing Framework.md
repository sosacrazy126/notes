Okay, here is the Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the implementation plan provided.

---
]
## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing an initial test suite for the `frontend/common` package. The goal is to improve code quality, increase reliability, and ensure maintainability by implementing automated testing using industry-standard tools. This foundational setup will allow for easier expansion of test coverage in the future.

## 2. Goals

*   Establish a robust and configurable testing framework within the `frontend/common` package.
*   Implement initial unit and component tests for critical utilities, state logic, and UI components.
*   Provide developers with the ability to run tests easily locally.
*   Lay the groundwork for potential CI integration and coverage reporting.

## 3. Non-Goals

*   Achieving 100% test coverage in this initial phase.
*   Adding tests to packages outside of `frontend/common`.
*   Implementing end-to-end tests.
*   Using testing frameworks other than `Jest` and `React Testing Library` (unless explicitly changed based on feedback).

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Core Testing Framework

*   **REQ-TEST-001:** The testing framework shall be `Jest`.
*   **REQ-TEST-002:** Component testing shall utilize `React Testing Library (RTL)`.
*   **REQ-TEST-003:** Tests shall run in a simulated browser environment provided by `jsdom`.
*   **REQ-TEST-004:** Enhanced DOM assertions shall be available via `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

### 4.2. Initial Test Suite Scope

*   **REQ-TEST-005:** Unit tests shall be created for the `stopAgentSession` API utility located in `frontend/common/src/utils/api.test.ts`.
*   **REQ-TEST-006:** Unit tests shall be created for the `stopSession` logic and related state mutations in the session store, located in `frontend/common/src/store/sessionStore.test.ts`.
*   **REQ-TEST-007:** Component tests shall be created for the `TimelineFeed` component, specifically testing the render and interaction of the "Stop Task" button, located in `frontend/common/src/components/TimelineFeed.test.tsx`.

### 4.3. Setup and Configuration

*   **REQ-TEST-008:** The following development dependencies must be added to the `frontend/common` package:
    *   `jest`
    *   `@types/jest`
    *   `ts-jest`
    *   `@testing-library/react`
    *   `@testing-library/jest-dom`
    *   `@testing-library/user-event`
    *   `jest-environment-jsdom`
*   **REQ-TEST-009:** A `jest.config.js` file shall be created in the `frontend/common` root with the following configuration:
    *   Preset: `ts-jest`
    *   Test Environment: `jsdom`
    *   Module File Extensions: `ts`, `tsx`, `js`
    *   Transform: Use `ts-jest` for `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
    *   Setup Files After Env: Point to a `jest.setup.ts` file.
    *   Test Match: Target `**/*.test.ts` and `**/*.test.tsx` files.
*   **REQ-TEST-010:** A `jest.setup.ts` file shall be created in the `frontend/common` root, and it must import `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
*   **REQ-TEST-011:** The `package.json` within `frontend/common` shall include the following scripts:
    *   `test`: Runs Jest using the `jest.config.js`.
    *   `test:watch`: Runs Jest in watch mode using the `jest.config.js`.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1. Dependencies Installation Command

```bash
pnpm add -D jest @types/jest ts-jest \
  @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom \
  @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 5.2. `jest.config.js` Content

```ts
// frontend/common/jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': 'ts-jest'
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],
  testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts', '**/*.test.tsx']
};
```

### 5.3. `jest.setup.ts` Content

```ts
// frontend/common/jest.setup.ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

### 5.4. `package.json` Scripts Addition

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ... existing scripts
    "test": "jest --config jest.config.js",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch --config jest.config.js"
  }
}
```

## 6. Future Considerations / Optional Enhancements

*   **CI Integration:** Configure CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run `pnpm run test` on pull requests or pushes.
*   **Coverage Enforcement:** Add `coverageThreshold` to `jest.config.js` to enforce minimum test coverage percentages.
*   **Documentation:** Add a test coverage badge to the `README.md` once reporting is configured.
*   **Test File Location:** Consider colocating test files (`*.test.tsx`) next to their corresponding source files instead of a central test directory if preferred.
*   **Alternative Framework:** Evaluate `Vitest` as an alternative to `Jest` if desired.
*   **Boilerplate Generation:** Potentially create helper scripts or tools to generate basic boilerplate test file content.

## 7. Open Questions

*   Is the default test file location (`*.test.(ts|tsx)` anywhere in the `src` tree) acceptable, or should tests be colocated with source files?
*   Is `Jest` the preferred framework, or should `Vitest` be considered?
