For this project: Always check CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md at the start of any conversation about this project. These files contain critical project context and must be updated with any changes. ((It's critical that you follow the self maintenance instructions in those files.))



# [Project Name] - Project Scope

## **IMPORTANT: PROJECT CONTINUITY**  
To maintain project context across conversations, always start a new chat with the following instructions:  

```
You are working on the [project name here]
Read CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md now, report your findings, and strictly follow all instructions found in these documents.  
You must complete the check-in process before proceeding with any task.  

Begin check-in process and document analysis.
```

## **IMPORTANT: SELF-MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS**  

### **Before Taking Any Action or Making Suggestions**  
1. **Read Both Files**:  
   - Read `CHANGELOG.md` and `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`.  
   - Immediately report:  
     ```
     Initializing new conversation...  
     Read [filename]: [key points relevant to current task]  
     Starting conversation history tracking...
     ```

2. **Review Context**:  
   - Assess existing features, known issues, and architectural decisions.  

3. **Inform Responses**:  
   - Use the gathered context to guide your suggestions or actions.  

4. **Proceed Only After Context Review**:  
   - Ensure all actions align with the project’s scope and continuity requirements.

---

### **After Making ANY Code Changes**  
1. **Update Documentation Immediately**:  
   - Add new features/changes to the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.  
   - Update `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` if there are changes to architecture, features, or limitations.

2. **Report Documentation Updates**:  
   - Use the following format to report updates:  
     ```
     Updated CHANGELOG.md: [details of what changed]  
     Updated PROJECT_SCOPE.md: [details of what changed] (if applicable)
     ```

3. **Ensure Alignment**:  
   - Verify that all changes align with existing architecture and features.

4. **Document All Changes**:  
   - Include specific details about:
     - New features or improvements
     - Bug fixes
     - Error handling changes
     - UI/UX updates
     - Technical implementation details

5. **Adhere to the Read-First/Write-After Approach**:

   - Always update documentation, even for minor changes.

2. **Update Before Responding to the User**:  
   - Ensure documentation is complete before providing feedback or solutions.

3. **For Multiple Changes**:
   - Document each change separately.
   - Maintain chronological order.
   - Group related changes together.

4. **For Each Feature/Change, Document**:
   - What was changed.
   - Why it was changed.
   - How it works.
   - Any limitations or considerations.

5. **If Unsure About Documentation**:
   - Err on the side of over-documenting.
   - Include all relevant details.

   - Report findings using this format:  
     ```
     Reviewed [file/section]: [relevant findings]
     ```

3. **Include Minimal Context for Current Task**:
   - Ensure findings directly inform the current task at hand.
