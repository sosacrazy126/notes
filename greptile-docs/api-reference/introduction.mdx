Greptile indexes large repos and then answers hard questions about them in natural language. Think of it as an **AI expert on your codebase**, available as an API. 

Example queries:

1. "How does auth work in this codebase?"
2. "Generate a comment for this PR with codebase context"
3. "How would I add pagination to the `/retrieve` endpoint?"

You can use the API in many ways: 
1. Integrate with **Slack** to answer codebase questions.
2. Integrate with **Sentry** to enrich alerts with codebase context, diagnoses, and resolution steps. 
3. Integrate with **GitHub** to review PRs and comment on new issues. 

We offer a growing list of [first-party integrations](https://app.greptile.com/login), or you can use the API to build your own. 

### Order of Operations
<Steps>
    <Step title="Index repo(s)">
     Use [`POST /repositories`](/api-reference/index) to submit a repo to get indexed.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Query repos">
       Use [`POST /query`](/api-reference/query) to query the repo or repos in natural language and get back an answer and a list of relevant files, functions, classes etc. 
    </Step>

    <Step title="Search repos">
        Optionally, use [`POST /search`](/api-reference/query) to search the repo or repos in natural language and get back just the list of relevant files, functions, classes etc., not the answer. 
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is `https://api.greptile.com/v2/`.

### Authentication
Two tokens are required:

**Greptile API key**: 

Include the API key in the request header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.
You can get your API key [here](https://app.greptile.com/login).

**GitHub Token**: 

Include this header with your GitHub/Gitlab access token for operations requiring GitHub access: 
`X-GitHub-Token: <GITHUB_TOKEN>`.

*Note: The read permissions on the GitHub/GitLab token determine which repos Greptile can reference in its answers.*
