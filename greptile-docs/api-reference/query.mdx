Submit a natural language query about the codebase, **get a natural language answer** with a list of relevant code references (filepaths, line numbers, etc)

1. "How does auth work in this codebase?"
2. "Generate a description for the JIRA ticket with codebase context"
3. "Rewrite this code snippet using relevant abstractions already in the repo"

Note: Before Greptile can query a repo, it must be indexed. See [Index Repository](/api-reference/index) for more information.
