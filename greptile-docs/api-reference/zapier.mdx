## Overview and Examples

Greptile + Zapier allows you to quickly integrate Greptile into your developer tools to make them smarter. 

The input is a prompt and one or more repositories, the output is a response with context from those repositories as well as links to specific locations in the code.

Some examples of how you could use it:
1. When a new issue is created in ClickUp, send the issue description to Greptile. Greptile will generate a codebase context-aware comment to help the developer get started with the ticket.
2. When a test fails in GitHub Actions, Greptile can generate a diagnosis with context from the codebase.
3. When there is a Sentry Alert, Greptile can generate a root cause analysis with context from the codebase.

## Authentication

To authenticate Greptile, you need a Greptile API key and a GitHub token.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Greptile API key can be provisioned [here](https://app.greptile.com/settings/api).
    </ Step>
    <Step>
        GitHub token can be provisioned [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Ensure it has access to the target repositories.
    </ Step>
</ Steps>

<Note>
    Greptile API Key must be formatted in the field as `Bearer api_key`.
</ Note>

## Input and Output Formats

The input is a `messages` array that contains the prompt and history of prompts/responses for conversational usecases as well as a `repositories` array that contains the repositories to reference.

The output is a `json` with `message` and `sources`. 

**Sample Input:**

`messages`:
```json
[
    {
        "content": "Diagnose this bug: `${stack_trace}`",
        "role": "user",
        "id": "0000"
    }
]
```

`repositories`:
```json
[
      {
         "repository":"helicone/helicone",
         "remote":"github",
         "branch":"main"
      }
]
```

**Sample Output:**

The output looks something like this:
```json
{
    "message": "Based on the code, there are several potential reasons why ClickHouse writes might be failing: ...",
    "sources": [
        {
            "repository": "helicone/helicone",
            "remote": "github", 
            "branch": "main",
            "filepath": "/valhalla/jawn/src/lib/db/ClickhouseWrapper.ts",
            "linestart": 82,
            "lineend": 92,
            "summary": "The `ClickhouseWrapper.ts` file contains the implementation of the...",
            "distance": 0.2171129350993909
        },
        {
            "remote": "github",
            "remoteUrl": null,
            "branch": "main",
            "repository": "helicone/helicone", 
            "filepath": "/valhalla/jawn/src/lib/db/ClickhouseWrapper.ts",
            "linestart": 1,
            "lineend": 80,
            "summary": "The `ClickhouseWrapper.ts` file contains the implementation of the...",
            "distance": 0
        }
    ]
}
