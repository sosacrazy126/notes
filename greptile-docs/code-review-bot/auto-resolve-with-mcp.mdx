<Note>Works with any MCP-compatible AI editor like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop</Note>

GitHub's MCP Server enables AI editors to directly interact with GitHub APIs, allowing you to automatically resolve Greptile code review comments without leaving your development environment.

## Prerequisites

- AI editor with MCP support ([Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop))
- GitHub personal access token with repository permissions
- [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) installed

## Setup GitHub MCP Server

### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -L https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/releases/latest/download/github-mcp-server-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o github-mcp-server
chmod +x github-mcp-server
```

### 2. Configure Your Editor

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cursor">
Add to your Cursor settings (`~/.cursor/mcp_servers.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "./github-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windsurf">
Add to your Windsurf MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "github": {
    "command": "./github-mcp-server",
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Claude Desktop">
Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "./github-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auto-Resolving Greptile Comments

### 1. Fetch PR Comments

Use your AI editor to fetch all comments from a pull request:

```
@github Can you get all the comments from PR #123 in owner/repo-name? Focus on the ones from the Greptile bot.
```

The MCP server will retrieve all PR comments, including those from Greptile's code review bot.

### 2. Analyze and Resolve

Ask your AI editor to resolve the comments:

```
Please analyze these Greptile comments and automatically resolve them by:
1. Opening the relevant files
2. Understanding the context of each comment
3. Implementing the suggested fixes
4. Ensuring the changes don't break existing functionality
```

### 3. Bulk Resolution Workflow

For efficiency, you can process multiple comments at once:

```
Please process all Greptile comments in this PR:
1. Group related comments by file
2. Prioritize critical issues (security, bugs) over style issues
3. Implement fixes in logical order
4. Create a summary of all changes made
```

## Advanced Usage

### Selective Resolution

Target specific types of comments:

```
@github Get comments from PR #123, then resolve only the security and performance related Greptile comments, ignoring style suggestions.
```

### Validation Workflow

Implement a validation step:

```
After resolving each Greptile comment:
1. Run relevant tests to ensure no regressions
2. Check if the fix addresses the root cause
3. Verify the change follows project conventions
4. Create a commit message explaining the fix
```

### Custom Patterns

Train your editor on your codebase patterns:

```
Before resolving Greptile comments, analyze the existing codebase to understand:
- Naming conventions
- Code organization patterns  
- Testing practices
- Documentation standards

Then ensure all fixes align with these patterns.
```

## Best Practices

<Card title="Review Before Committing" icon="eye" horizontal>
Always review AI-generated fixes before committing, especially for complex logic changes.
</Card>

<Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="flask" horizontal>
Run your test suite after resolving comments to catch any regressions.
</Card>

<Card title="Incremental Approach" icon="stairs" horizontal>
Start with style and simple fixes before tackling complex logic issues.
</Card>

<Card title="Context Awareness" icon="brain" horizontal>
Ensure your AI editor understands the full context of changes, not just individual files.
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

**MCP Server not responding**: Verify your GitHub token has sufficient permissions and the server binary is executable.

**Comments not fetching**: Ensure the repository name and PR number are correct, and you have read access to the repository.

**Fixes breaking tests**: The AI may need more context about your testing patterns and validation requirements.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fetch PR comments
"@github List all comments from PR #456 in myorg/myrepo"

# 2. Filter for Greptile comments  
"Show me only the comments from the Greptile bot"

# 3. Resolve systematically
"Starting with the most critical issues, please resolve each Greptile comment by implementing the suggested fixes"

# 4. Validate changes
"Run the test suite and verify all fixes are working correctly"
```

This workflow transforms Greptile's code review insights into actionable fixes, significantly accelerating your development cycle while maintaining code quality.
