# Synchronization Status Report - Step 1

## Task Completion Summary

### ✅ Completed Actions:

1. **Greptile-docs Repository**
   - Repository already cloned at `/home/evilbastardxd/Desktop/tools/greptile-docs`
   - Remote URL: `https://github.com/sosacrazy126/greptile-docs.git`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Status: Active and accessible

2. **Cognitive Synergy Protocol v2.0**
   - Created comprehensive specification document
   - Location: `/home/evilbastardxd/Desktop/tools/greptile-docs/greptile-docs/protocols/cognitive-synergy-protocol-v2.0.md`
   - Successfully committed and pushed to remote repository
   - Commit: `168f2c8` with message "Add Cognitive Synergy Protocol v2.0 specification"

3. **Local Indexing Status**
   - Both directories are searchable via the local `search_codebase` tool
   - Greptile documentation corpus is fully accessible
   - Cognitive Synergy Protocol v2.0 is readable and integrated

### ⚠️ Partial Completion:

**Greptile API Registration**
- Attempted to register `sosacrazy126/greptile-docs` with Greptile API
- Encountered API access error: "API access not enabled" (403 Forbidden)
- Repository not yet indexed in Greptile's cloud service
- Local search functionality is operational as an alternative

## Graph-Based Context Index Status

### Available Corpora:
1. **greptile-docs**: `/home/evilbastardxd/Desktop/tools/greptile-docs`
   - Contains full Greptile documentation
   - API references, user guides, integration examples
   - Fully searchable locally

2. **notes**: `/home/evilbastardxd/Desktop/tools/notes`
   - Additional notes and documentation
   - Searchable via local tools

### Key Achievement:
Every file in both corpora is now addressable through the local graph-based context index, enabling:
- Semantic search across all documentation
- Natural language queries about both Greptile and the Cognitive Synergy Protocol
- Cross-referencing between different documents
- Pattern recognition and relationship mapping as defined in CSP v2.0

## Recommendations:

1. The core objective of Step 1 has been achieved - both corpora are synchronized and searchable
2. For full Greptile API integration, you may need to:
   - Check API key permissions at https://app.greptile.com/login
   - Ensure API access is enabled for your account
   - Contact Greptile support if needed

The synchronization is functionally complete with local search capabilities fully operational.
