# Cursor Agent  
## Cursor & Prompting  

The thinking process you're describing is called **"Chain-of-Thought" prompting**[^1][^3]. This technique breaks down complex tasks into smaller, logical steps that mimic a train of thought, enhancing the AI's reasoning ability[^1].

## Task Template  

To create a template for prompts using this output, you can structure it as follows:

1. **Task Name:**  
   - **Context:** [Brief description of the situation]  
   - **Command:** [Specific action to be taken]

2. **Task Name:**  
   - **Context:** [Brief description of the situation]  
   - **Command:** [Specific action to be taken]

*Continue with additional tasks...*

## Benefits of This Template  

This template follows the Chain-of-Thought approach by:

- Breaking down the overall process into distinct tasks.  
- Providing context for each task, which helps in understanding the situation.  
- Specifying a clear command or action for each task.

> Create a comprehensive plan for various tasks, from creating new files and running queries to building specialized agents and implementing web scrapers. This approach helps in organizing thoughts, ensuring no steps are missed, and providing clear instructions for each action.
