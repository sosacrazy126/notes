# Summary of "the developer experience around"

This video explores the challenges and insights around benchmarking large language models (LLMs), focusing on performance, cost, and speed. The presenter introduces a dynamic benchmarking tool designed to evaluate single-word autocomplete tasks across various LLMs, including Claude 3.5, GPT-4, and others. The video discusses the trade-offs between model accuracy, speed, and pricing, highlighting the importance of tailored benchmarks for real-world use cases.

## Introduction and Purpose

[00:00:00]  
- Benchmarks for LLMs are often **cherry-picked** and fail to represent true competition.  
- Difficulty in understanding model performance when considering **speed, price, and accuracy together**.  
- Introduction of a simple tool to benchmark single-word autocomplete tasks across multiple LLMs.

---

## Benchmarking Setup and Metrics

[00:01:00]  
- The tool sends debounced autocomplete requests to all listed models simultaneously.  
- Key metrics tracked:  
  - **Execution time** (speed)  
  - **Execution cost** (price)  
  - **Relative cost** (cost comparison normalized to the cheapest model)  
  - **Accuracy** via user downvotes on incorrect completions.

[00:02:00]  
- Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B identified as the cheapest baseline model.  
- Claude 3.5 H Coup is up to **100x more expensive** than Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B.  
- Emphasis on **low-cost, high-speed, high-performance models** as valuable options.

---

## Using the Benchmark Tool

[00:03:00]  
- Users can downvote incorrect completions to mark errors.  
- The tool saves results locally and updates dynamically with new inputs.  
- Examples tested include words like "analyze," "calc," "send," and "tax rate."  
- Observations of model-specific performance differences and error rates.

---

## Prompt Design and Flexibility

[00:06:00]  
- The prompt replaces the last word in the input text for autocomplete.  
- Designed to produce **yes/no validatable responses** for easy correctness evaluation.  
- The prompt is **dynamic and reactive**, allowing real-time adjustments and reruns.  
- Can be adapted for various autocomplete tasks beyond code, such as API documentation or phrases.

## Performance and Cost Insights

[00:12:00]  
- Claude 3.5 H Coup is surprisingly the **slowest model** in total execution time despite expectations.  
- Sonet model leads in accuracy with zero mistakes in tested completions.  
- Claude 3.5 H Coup is a **high-performing but expensive and slower model**, positioned as a "little brother" to Sonet.  
- Fast, cheap models like GPT-4 Mini and Flash 8B offer a good balance but with some accuracy trade-offs.

[00:16:00]  
- Predicted outputs feature in GPT-4 and GPT-4 Mini shows promise with **faster execution times** and slight price increases.  
- Some models show variability in speed possibly due to network latency or usage patterns.

## Accuracy and Model Ranking

[00:18:00]  
- Cheapest models (Flash 8B) perform worst, illustrating the **trade-off between cost and accuracy**.  
- Most fast predictive models cluster around ~60% accuracy in this small sample.  
- Top performers by accuracy:  
  - Claude 3.5 Sonet  
  - Claude 3.5 H Coup Pro  
  - Claude 3.5 H Coup

[00:21:00]  
- Relative pricing shows a steep increase from cheapest to most expensive models.  
- Claude 3.5 H Coup charges about **$1 per million tokens**, significantly higher than cheaper alternatives.  
- Fast, cheap models contain **"incredible intelligence"** at a low price point, making them attractive for many use cases.

---

## Limitations and Future Directions

[00:24:00]  
- The benchmark is **not perfect**: small sample size, network latency, and lack of token caching considerations.  
- Encouragement to run **larger sample sizes** and tailor benchmarks to specific use cases.  
- Plans to add features like dynamic model selection and more comprehensive stats.  
- Upcoming benchmarks on new hardware (e.g., MacBook Pro with M4 chip) to compare local vs. cloud models.

---

## Conclusion

- The video emphasizes the importance of **balancing performance, cost, and speed** when selecting LLMs.  
- Fast, low-cost models are often undervalued despite their strong performance in many tasks.  
- Claude 3.5 H Coup is a **high-tier, slower, and more expensive model**, suitable for use cases prioritizing accuracy over cost.  
- The presented benchmarking tool offers a **flexible, reactive way to evaluate models** and can be adapted for various autocomplete scenarios.  
- Viewers are encouraged to test models against their own needs and contribute ideas for future benchmarking improvements.
