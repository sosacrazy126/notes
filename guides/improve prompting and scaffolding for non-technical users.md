To optimize your workflow with codebase-aware AI agents like Greptile and downstream tools like Cursor IDE, here's a structured approach to improve prompting and scaffolding for non-technical users:

## Core Strategy for Effective AI Collaboration

**1. Architectural Blueprinting First**

- **Template**: _"Create a blueprint for [feature] that integrates with [existing module/class] in [codebase]. Prioritize [security/performance/maintainability]."_
    
- Example: _"Design a user analytics feature that connects to our existing UserManager class in auth.py, using Python type hints for clarity."_[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cvw3s5/my_personal_guide_for_developing_software_with_ai/)[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)
    

**2. Context Anchoring with Symbols**  
Leverage existing codebase elements even without knowing technical terms:

python

`# Bad: "Make a payment system" # Good: "Extend the checkout() method in store/orders.py to support Stripe subscriptions, mirroring how PayPal integration works in payments/gateways.py"`

Greptile understands cross-file references when you specify files/methods[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)

**3. Iterative Refinement Workflow**

1. **Initial Prompt**: _"Generate starter code for [feature] using patterns from [existing feature/file]"_
    
2. **Validation**: _"Identify potential conflicts between this generated code and [file X] [class Y]"_
    
3. **Implementation**: _"Convert this blueprint into complete functions with type hints and error handling"_
    
4. **Testing**: _"Create pytest cases validating [specific edge case] against this implementation"_[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cvw3s5/my_personal_guide_for_developing_software_with_ai/)[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)
    

## Technical Bridge for Non-Developers

**Problem-Specific Scaffolding**

|Your Understanding|AI-Optimized Prompt Structure|
|---|---|
|"Need login security"|_"Implement 2FA in auth.py following OWASP guidelines, using the same config pattern as email_verification()"_|
|"Slow page loads"|_"Profile routes/api.py endpoint get_user_data() and suggest optimizations matching cache strategy from products/listings.py"_|

**Test Generation Without Technical Jargon**

- _"Create validation checks ensuring the new [feature] behaves like [existing working feature] in [test scenario]"_
    
- _"Generate tests covering all decision branches shown in this flow diagram: [attach MSPaint sketch]"_[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)[6](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-python-expert-guide)
    

## Workflow Optimization Tips

1. **Third-Party Integration Pattern**:  
    _"Add [library] to [codebase] using the same setup pattern as [existing integration] in [file]. Ensure compatibility with [specific constraint]."_[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)
    
2. **Contextual Constraints**:
    
    python
    
    `# Instead of: "Make it faster" "Optimize data_processor() in utils/transform.py to handle 10x payload sizes while maintaining <2s response time, using the parallelization approach from image_processing.py"` 
    
3. **Automated Validation Prompts**:
    
    - _"Verify this implementation follows [codebase]'s error logging standards from logger/ config"_
        
    - _"Check for consistency with [codebase]'s [naming conventions/docstring format/type hint usage]"_[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1cvw3s5/my_personal_guide_for_developing_software_with_ai/)[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)
        

## Maintenance & Scaling

**Change Management Protocol**

1. _"Generate migration plan for updating [dependency] in [codebase] considering breaking changes in [specific module]"_
    
2. _"Create backward-compatibility layer for [old feature] during transition to [new system]"_[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)[6](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-python-expert-guide)
    

Your current 70-85% completion rate suggests effective foundational patterns. To bridge the remaining gap, focus prompts on **codebase cross-references** and **pattern replication** rather than technical specifics. Greptile's multi-repo context[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide) allows leveraging documented patterns from major OSS projects as implicit references without needing to name them explicitly.

For terminology gaps, use analogies:  
_"Implement a file cache similar to how we handle user sessions, but with [specific difference]"_  
The AI can map conceptual relationships without exact technical terms[1](https://apostrophecms.com/blog/the-art-of-asking-questions-in-the-age-of-ai)[4](https://www.greptile.com/docs/prompt-guide)

Break It Down: Split complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps so the agent can focus on one piece at a time.

Ask for Explanations: Request the agent to explain its suggestions or code in simple terms to help you understand and refine your next prompt.
