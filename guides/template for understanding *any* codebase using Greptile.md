# Codebase Comprehension Template  
**Leverage Greptile to rapidly grasp, adapt, and debug projects.**  

---

## 1. High-Level Overview  
*Understand architecture, flow, and core components.*  

- **What‚Äôs the project‚Äôs primary purpose, and what architectural pattern does it follow?**  
  (e.g., MVC, microservices)  
- **Can you map the data flow from user input to final output?**  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúHow does [Project X] process tasks?‚Äù)*  
- **Where are the main entry points and critical modules located?**  
  (e.g., `main.js`, `app.py`)  

---

## 2. Key Components & Interactions  
*Identify critical files, dependencies, and integrations.*  

- **Which modules handle [specific functionality, e.g., AI logic, database ops]?**  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúWhich files interact with external APIs like Claude?‚Äù)*  
- **How do components communicate?**  
  (e.g., event-driven, REST calls)  
- **What third-party services/libraries are used, and where are they integrated?**  

---

## 3. Implementation Details  
*Dive into functions, data structures, and logic.*  

- **List core functions/classes responsible for [key feature].**  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúShow functions calling the Anthropic API.‚Äù)*  
- **How is data stored or modified?**  
  (e.g., in-memory, databases)  
- **Where is input validation or error handling implemented?**  

---

## 4. Configuration & Secrets  
*Trace environment setup and security practices.*  

- **How are credentials/secrets managed?**  
  (e.g., API keys, environment variables)  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúHow is the Claude API key injected?‚Äù)*  
- **Are there environment-specific configurations?**  
  (e.g., `dev` vs `prod`)  

---

## 5. Adaptation & Refactoring  
*Plan changes for new requirements or integrations.*  

- **Which modules need updates to replace [Legacy Service X] with [New Service Y]?**  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúRefactor `callClaude()` for Cursor‚Äôs model.‚Äù)*  
- **How should I modify [specific file] to integrate [new feature/docs]?**  
- **Are there hardcoded values or tightly coupled components to decouple?**  

---

## 6. Testing & Debugging  
*Ensure reliability during and after modifications.*  

- **Generate test cases for [refactored component].**  
  *(e.g., ‚ÄúTest cases for AI prompt formatting.‚Äù)*  
- **What logging or metrics exist to debug [specific module]?**  
- **Are there known edge cases or race conditions?**  

---

## 7. Project Setup  
*Onboard efficiently.*  

- **What dependencies/tools are required, and how are they installed?**  
- **Are there scripts or CI/CD pipelines for setup, testing, or deployment?**  

---

## Example Usage for Claude ‚Üí Cursor Migration  

    ### 5. Adaptation & Refactoring  
    - "Which files use Claude‚Äôs API endpoints that need Cursor-compatible prompts?"  
    - "How to replace `validateClaudeResponse()` with Cursor‚Äôs response schema?"  

---

## Tips  

- Start with **high-level questions** before drilling into specifics.  
- Use answers to iteratively refine follow-up queries (e.g., ‚ÄúShow me the implementation of `X` from the previous summary‚Äù).  

---

*Let me know if you‚Äôd like to simulate this for a specific codebase! üõ†Ô∏è*  

---

**This template balances generality with actionable examples, allowing users to adapt it to their project by replacing placeholders (e.g., `[Project X]`, `[Legacy Service X]`).**
