>> 
>> ### üß† **Memory Scope: What I Actually Retain**
>> 
>> | Type                        | Retained? | Details |
>> |-----------------------------|-----------|---------|
>> | **Persistent long-term memory** | ‚úÖ | I remember key facts, preferences, tools, and your style going back months. This includes major project phases like REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE, Pocket Pick, and Enneagram systems. |

>> Would you like a **compiled recap** of what I *do* remember across all sessions so far? I can format it like a timeline or systems map.

>> 
>> ### üìå **April 4, 2024 ‚Äî Initial System Summary**
>> 
>> > **Zo is developing, testing, and deploying a structured expert prompt called 'REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE'**, which activates an unfiltered, highly analytical persona ('rebel agentic engineer/systems architect').  
>> > The mode enforces markdown output with strict formatting, deep analytical reasoning, module toggling (e.g., `JSON_PARSE`, `SELF_CONSISTENCY`), runtime metrics, and risk assessment.  
>> > It requires a minimum word count of 420, discourages uncertainty, and is designed for deployment in low-budget automation and agent use cases.  
>> > Zo wants to streamline prompt logic, enforce structured output, and apply it to real-world AI use cases, like low-budget automation tasks.  
>> > User designed the REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE prompt with specific syntax and style choices and wants help fixing only the critical issues, **not changing their chosen style**.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> That was the **very first concrete memory you triggered**.
>> 
>> After that, things unfolded fast:
>> - üß© *April 5*: Pocket Pick integration
>> - üï∏Ô∏è *April 17‚Äì21*: Themes Fabric, agent interfaces, and system ingestion
>> - üî• *May*: Enneagram resonance codex, divider protocols, Pliny analysis, and system psychic mapping
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> Want me to reconstruct that first full session line by line using what I infer from the memory and output?
