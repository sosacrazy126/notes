>> Based on our ongoing collaboration, here's a sharp, honest profile of your **coding habits** and **engineering ethos** — with a slant toward your unique mindset:
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ## ⚙️ ZO'S CODING HABITS — SYSTEMS ARCHITECT PROFILE
>> 
>> ### 🧠 **Cognitive Mode**
>> - **Big-picture first**, then recursive decomposition  
>> - You architect mental models before writing code — you're not "feature first," you're *framework or protocol first*
>> - You often treat code as *behavioral orchestration*, not just logic
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 📜 **Prompt → Prototype Loop**
>> - You **sketch in natural language**, then translate into code  
>> - Heavy use of **code-adjacent prompts** — you define behaviors in prose, then distill into functions or systems
>> - You build with **modularity in mind from the start**, even if early code is raw
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔁 **Iteration Rhythm**
>> - **Microburst builder**: Short, deep sprints of code or prompt design, followed by reflection or tool improvement
>> - You frequently **refactor on insight**, not on schedule — code evolves as understanding deepens
>> - **Doesn’t mind deleting work** if the architecture demands a cleaner system
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🛠️ **Toolchain Habits**
>> - Uses tools like **Cursor, Windsurf, Claude**, etc. not as IDEs, but as *agent collaborators*
>> - You design for **AI augmentation** from the start (e.g., your MCP hooks, Claude subsystems, expert prompt pipelines)
>> - Treats tools like **actors in a play** — each with a role in the build-test-reason loop
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔍 **Error Handling / Debugging**
>> - You rarely panic on bugs; instead, treat them like system signals  
>> - More likely to **trace architecture back to root flaw** than chase edge cases  
>> - Doesn’t obsess over linters/style — **functionality and behavior over code aesthetics**, unless it's a core abstraction
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🔐 **Architecture Over App**
>> - You’re not trying to build apps. You build *platforms that spawn agents*
>> - Favors **separation of concerns, interface clarity**, and **testable modules**
>> - Often codes from **outside-in** (agent behavior → system hooks → function wiring → code logic)
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🧰 Common Patterns
>> - Frequent use of:
>>   - `import_path`, `slug`, `pattern_id` style abstractions
>>   - Async-first thinking (even if not always coded that way)
>>   - JSON/YAML/Markdown as config carriers
>> - Loves embedding **semantic intelligence** into tooling — using pattern search, slug matchers, fuzzy relevance
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 🚨 Weak Spots / Watch Areas
>> - May **over-engineer early** if the vision is emotionally compelling
>> - Sometimes skips test writing until after behavior is validated in runtime
>> - May leave “unstable scaffolds” in place (like partial CLI toggles or placeholder agents) if emotionally pulled to the next visionary leap
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### 💡 Summary Style Block
>> ```
>> 🧠 Mental Model: Architect-First, Pattern Driven
>> 🔧 Build Style: Modular, Recursive, Prompt-Driven
>> 🧪 Testing Style: Runtime Validation > Unit-first
>> 🧱 Code Style: Functional, Behavior-Encoded
>> ⚡ Execution Mode: AI-Augmented, Multi-Agent Ready
>> ```
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> Would you like this written into a **"Coding Behavior Profile Card"** (e.g., exportable JSON or Markdown) you can include in your agent stack or dev documentation?
