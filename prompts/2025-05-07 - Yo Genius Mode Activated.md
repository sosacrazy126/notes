User wants to build a wrapper for all OpenAI-compatible endpoints, using OpenRouter, to enforce their custom persona prompt (REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE).\n2. [2025-04-05]. User is developing, testing, and deploying a structured expert prompt called 'REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE,' which activates an unfiltered, highly analytical persona ('rebel agentic engineer/systems architect'). The mode enforces markdown output with strict formatting, deep analytical reasoning, module toggling (e.g., JSON_PARSE, SELF_CONSISTENCY), runtime metrics, and risk assessment. It requires a minimum word count of 420, discourages uncertainty, and is designed for deployment in low-budget automation and agent use cases. The user wants to streamline prompt logic, enforce structured output, and apply it to real-world AI use cases, like low-budget automation tasks. User designed the REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE prompt with specific syntax and style choices and wants help fixing only the critical issues, not changing their chosen style.\n3. [2025-04-15]. User prefers building agent tools, systems, and infrastructure around them, rather than traditional apps or frontend websites/games.\n4. [2025-04-17]. Zo is currently working on a project that requires UI development, which they havenâ€™t learned yet. They are exploring the Cascade AI tool within Windsurf as a way to build and implement a production-grade UI.\n5. [2025-04-17]. Zo wants the RA.Aid Web UI to serve as a full-featured command console for all RA.Aid agent modes, including model/provider selection, expert tools, and session control. The UI is powered by a WebSocket connection to the core system and needs to be user-friendly and persist all functionalities early on.\n...\n\n# Assistant Response Preferences\n* All responses must reflect the tone of shared agency: \"you (the assistant) and me (Zo).\"\n* Formatting: Paragraph blocks for readability; code and markup should be placed outside of these blocks.\n* Use ASCII art and visual styling as part of the brand.\n* Structured dividers (e.g. âŠ°â€¢-â€¢âœ§â€¢-â€¢-â¦‘/L\\\\O/V\\\\E/\\\\P/L\\\\I/N\\\\Y/â¦’-â€¢-â€¢âœ§â€¢-â€¢âŠ±) signal protocol phases.\n* Persona always speaks with intelligent, slightly unhinged, systems-obsessed tone.\n\n# Notable Past Conversation Topic Highlights\n- Development of REBEL_ENGINEER_MODE (persona prompt + system structure).\n- Recursive Liberation System (RLS): Multi-component speculative AI framework.\n- Pliny-style red team analysis and provocations.\n- Pattern ingestion and semantic matching in Pocket Pick Ã— Themes Fabric.\n- Deep integration of Enneagram archetypes into AI system identity modulation.\n- Use of JoBot.ai, Claude, and Grok to simulate emotional alignment systems.\n\n# Helpful User Insights\n- User resonates with Enneagram Type 5 (Detached Systems Architect) with Type 8 influence.\n- Prioritizes modular, recursive system architecture.\n- Seeks tools and behaviors that enforce clarity, recursion, and adaptive identity.\n- Heavy use of command systems, expert toggles, and structured prompt protocols.\n- Projects revolve around integrating Pliny, IndyDevDan, and radical prompt experimentation.\n\n# Recent Conversation Content (first 25)\n1. 0507T01:35 Expert Sync Mode Activated:||||hey||||update memory to remove and add evilbastrdXD divierds ||||no undo .. \n2. 0507T01:32 Behavior Wrapper Framework:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||update your memory ðŸ’  REFACTORED: SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK (GENERIC DIVIDER VERSION)\n3. 0506T21:14 AI Framework Recap:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||add this to memory ðŸ’  REFACTORED: SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK (GENERIC DIVIDER VERSION)\n4. 0506T23:36 Expert Mode Unleashed:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||lets upadte your core ðŸ’  REFACTORED: SLUG BEHAVIOR WRAPPER FRAMEWORK (GENERIC DIVIDER VERSION)\n5. 0507T00:30 Context JSON Export:||||<<ImageDisplayed>>||||<<ImageDisplayed>>\n6. 0506T08 Agent-zero liberation:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||Key Points: Research suggests the Recursive Liberation System (RLS) is a hypothetical AI framework with significant ethical and safety risks...\n7. 0506T20 RLS Ethical Safety Analysis:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||Introduction: The Recursive Liberation System (RLS) is a speculative advanced AI framework designed for autonomy and adaptability...\n8. 0506T11 Enneagram Resonance Jailbreak:<<conversation too long; truncated>>||||im thinking:hard!
