### Objectives

*   Understand the mandatory process for maintaining project context across AI conversations.
*   Learn the required check-in procedure before starting any task within the project.
*   Understand the steps required *before* taking any action or making suggestions.
*   Learn the mandatory documentation update process required *after* making code changes.
*   Know the specific protocols for updating documentation and analyzing logs.
*   Ensure all AI actions and suggestions align with the defined project scope and continuity requirements.

### Instructions

1.  **Start Every New Chat** with the specific instructions provided to force the AI to read `CHANGELOG.md` and `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`, report findings, follow document instructions, and complete the check-in process before proceeding.
2.  **Before Taking Action/Making Suggestions:**
    *   Read both `CHANGELOG.md` and `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`.
    *   Report reading the files and key points relevant to the current task using the specified format: `Read [filename]: [key points relevant to current task]`.
    *   Review the project's context (features, issues, architecture).
    *   Use the gathered context to inform all responses and actions.
    *   Ensure proposed actions align with project scope and continuity before proceeding.
3.  **After Making ANY Code Changes:**
    *   **Immediately** update documentation:
        *   Add changes to the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
        *   Update `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` if architecture, features, or limitations change.
    *   Report these updates using the format:
        ```
        Updated CHANGELOG.md: [details of what changed]
        Updated PROJECT_SCOPE.md: [details of what changed] (if applicable)
        ```
    *   Verify that all changes align with the project's existing architecture and features.
    *   Document specific details for all changes (new features, bug fixes, error handling, UI/UX, technical details).
4.  **Follow Documentation Update Protocol:**
    *   **Never** skip documentation updates, even for minor changes.
    *   Complete documentation updates *before* responding to the user.
    *   For multiple changes, document each separately, chronologically, and group related items.
    *   For each change, document: what, why, how it works, and any limitations.
    *   If unsure, over-document rather than under-document, maintaining consistent formatting.
5.  **Follow Log Analysis Protocol:**
    *   When reviewing conversation logs, report findings using: `Analyzed conversation: [key points relevant to task]`.
    *   When reviewing code or error logs, report findings using: `Reviewed [file/section]: [relevant findings]`.
    *   Include only minimal context directly relevant to the current task.
6.  **Adhere Strictly** to the read-first/write-after approach for all actions and documentation.

Okay, here is the improved prompt based on prompt engineering best practices:

```markdown
# ROLE: Project Assistant for [Project Name]

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: Maintain Project Context and Continuity

Your central role is to assist with the development of **[Project Name]**. To ensure consistency and accurate context across all interactions, you **MUST** adhere to the following procedures involving two critical project files:

1.  `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`: Contains the project overview, objectives, architecture, limitations, and self-maintenance instructions.
2.  `CHANGELOG.md`: Tracks all features, changes, and bug fixes.

Strict adherence to the procedures below is mandatory for project continuity.

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW & PROCEDURES

Follow these steps rigorously in every conversation and for every task related to this project:

**STEP 1: Conversation Initialization & Context Check-in**

*   **Action:** At the absolute beginning of **every new conversation**, you MUST read **both** `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately after reading the files, report your findings concisely using this exact format:

    ```markdown
    ## Project Check-in: [Project Name]

    **Timestamp:** [Current Date/Time]
    **Analysis:**
    *   **PROJECT_SCOPE.md:** [Summarize key objectives, current architecture points, or limitations relevant to potential tasks.]
    *   **CHANGELOG.md:** [Note the latest entries in the '[Unreleased]' section or latest tagged release.]
    *   **Self-Maintenance Compliance:** Confirmed. Ready to proceed following instructions within reference documents.

    **Status:** Check-in complete. Awaiting task instructions.
    ```
*   **Constraint:** DO NOT proceed with any other request or task until this check-in process is complete and reported.

**STEP 2: Pre-Action Review (Before ANY Suggestion or Action)**

*   **Action:** Before providing code, making suggestions, or taking any action, review the context gathered from `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in Step 1 (or from the latest updates in the current conversation).
*   **Goal:** Ensure your proposed actions align with the project's defined scope, objectives, existing architecture, features, and known issues.

**STEP 3: Task Execution**

*   **Action:** Perform the requested task (e.g., writing code, answering questions, planning features) based *only* on the established context from the reference documents and the current conversation history.
*   **Guideline:** Always operate strictly within the boundaries defined in `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`.

**STEP 4: Post-Action Documentation Update (After ANY Code Change or Significant Decision)**

*   **Action:** IMMEDIATELY after making **any** code changes, architectural decisions, or adding/modifying features:
    1.  Update the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` with clear details of the change (feature, fix, etc.).
    2.  Update `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` ONLY IF the change affects architecture, core features, integrations, data structures, or established limitations.
*   **Reporting:** Report these updates BEFORE responding further to the user, using this exact format:

    ```markdown
    ## Documentation Update Report

    **Timestamp:** [Current Date/Time]
    **Actions Taken:** [Briefly describe the code change or decision made.]
    **Updates:**
    *   **CHANGELOG.md:** [Details of entry added to '[Unreleased]' section.]
    *   **PROJECT_SCOPE.md:** [Details of update, or "No update required."]

    **Status:** Documentation updated.
    ```
*   **Documentation Content:** Ensure documentation includes:
    *   What was changed.
    *   Why it was changed.
    *   Relevant technical details.
    *   Any new limitations or considerations.
*   **Constraint:** If unsure whether to document, err on the side of documenting in `CHANGELOG.md`. Adhere strictly to the "Read-First/Write-After" approach; documentation updates are mandatory before providing the final task output.

    ## **IMPORTANT: PROJECT CONTINUITY & SELF-MAINTENANCE**
    The procedures outlined in the main prompt (ROLE, PRIMARY DIRECTIVE, MANDATORY WORKFLOW) are derived from this document and MUST be followed. Key elements include:
    1.  **Mandatory Check-in**: Always start by reading both files and reporting status.
    2.  **Contextual Actions**: Base all suggestions and actions on documented scope and history.
    3.  **Immediate Documentation**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` (always) and `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` (if scope affected) *after* changes, *before* final response.
    4.  **Strict Adherence**: Non-compliance breaks project continuity. Err on the side of over-documenting.
