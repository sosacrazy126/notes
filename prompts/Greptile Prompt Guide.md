üìå **Greptile Prompt Guide: Enhancing Development with LLM-Powered Insights**

*A tool for developers to navigate complex codebases, debug issues, and implement changes efficiently with AI assistance.*

---

## üîπ Overview (TL;DR)
- **Main idea:** Greptile is an LLM-powered tool that helps developers understand, debug, and modify codebases by providing code references, explanations, and implementation steps.
- **Key takeaways:**  
  - Assists in explaining code structure, diagnosing errors, and planning complex changes.  
  - Integrates with third-party libraries and evaluates security/performance.  
  - Best used with specific, detailed questions and referenced symbols.
- **Next actions:** Explore use cases like "How to fix a bug using error traces" or integrate with external repos.

## üîç Key Concepts

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Idea** ‚¨áÔ∏è
> Greptile acts as a codebase assistant, leveraging AI to decode functionality, diagnose issues, and suggest actionable changes by querying specific code or errors.

<details>
  <summary>Expand for more details</summary>
  
  - **Detailed breakdown:**  
    - Provides explanations for code files (e.g., "What does `api/proc.ts` do?").  
    - Links error messages to relevant code locations and logical fixes.  
    - Maps complex task requirements to precise code modifications (e.g., updating a chat UI).  
  - **Related concepts:**  
    - Combines code understanding, debugging, and design skills.  
    - Complementary to IDE tools for broader architectural questions.

  <summary>Expand for details</summary>

  - **Deep dive:**  
    - Adds external repos (e.g., `nextauthjs/next-auth`) to solve integration tasks like "Add Google sign-in."  
    - Identifies performance bottlenecks or security risks in specified files.  
  - **Practical applications:**  
    - Diagnosing dependency-related bugs by including the dependency‚Äôs codebase.  
    - Generating code snippets for new features with placement guidance.  
  - **Common pitfalls / misconceptions:**  
    - Treat security/performance feedback as a guide, not a definitive audit.  
    - Requires precise prompting for optimal results‚Äîgeneral questions may yield vague answers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Actionable Steps / Implementation
- **How to apply this knowledge**
  - ‚úÖ Step 1: **Pinpoint your need**: Ask specific questions like, "Why does the profile dropdown cause a refresh?" or "How to store the sidebar state in local storage?"
  - ‚úÖ Step 2: **Add relevant repos**: For third-party features, include both your code and the library‚Äôs (e.g., `stripe/stripe-node` for billing).
  - ‚úÖ Step 3: **Request structured outputs**: Specify if you want code snippets, step-by-step plans, or concise answers (e.g., "Generate code for the API route").
