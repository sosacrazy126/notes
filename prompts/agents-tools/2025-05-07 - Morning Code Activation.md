>> **FastAPI-MCP** is a powerful tool designed to expose your FastAPI endpoints as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, complete with authentication support. This integration facilitates seamless interaction between your FastAPI applications and AI agents or other services that utilize the MCP standard.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Key Features
>> 
>> - **FastAPI-Native Integration**: FastAPI-MCP is not merely a converter; it's a native extension of FastAPI. This design choice ensures minimal configuration and leverages FastAPI's existing structures.
>> 
>> - **Built-in Authentication**: Utilizes FastAPI's `Depends()` for authentication and authorization, allowing you to secure your MCP endpoints using familiar patterns.
>> 
>> - **ASGI Transport**: Communicates directly with your FastAPI app using its ASGI interface, eliminating the need for HTTP calls from the MCP to your API.
>> 
>> - **Schema Preservation**: Maintains the schemas of your request and response models, ensuring consistency and reliability.
>> 
>> - **Flexible Deployment**: You can mount the MCP server directly to your FastAPI app or deploy it separately, providing flexibility in your architecture.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Getting Started
>> 
>> **Installation**:
>> 
>> You can install FastAPI-MCP using `uv`, a fast Python package installer:
>> 
>> 
>> ```bash
>> uv add fastapi-mcp
>> ```
>> 
>> 
>> Alternatively, use `pip`:
>> 
>> 
>> ```bash
>> pip install fastapi-mcp
>> ```
>> 
>> 
>> **Basic Usage**:
>> 
>> Here's how you can integrate FastAPI-MCP into your FastAPI application:
>> 
>> 
>> ```python
>> from fastapi import FastAPI
>> from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP
>> 
>> app = FastAPI()
>> 
>> mcp = FastApiMCP(app)
>> 
>> # Mount the MCP server directly to your FastAPI app
>> mcp.mount()
>> ```
>> 
>> 
>> Once set up, your auto-generated MCP server will be available at `https://app.base.url/mcp`.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Advanced Usage
>> 
>> FastAPI-MCP provides several ways to customize and control how your MCP server is created and configured. For instance, you can filter which endpoints are exposed as MCP tools using parameters like `include_operations`, `exclude_operations`, `include_tags`, and `exclude_tags`. citeturn0search6
>> 
>> Additionally, you can deploy the MCP server separately from your FastAPI application, offering more flexibility in managing your services.
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Best Practices
>> 
>> When converting standard APIs into MCP tools for use with AI agents, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure proper tool exposure and functionality. This includes maintaining clear and consistent schemas, handling authentication appropriately, and structuring your application to facilitate easy integration. citeturn0search4
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Community and Support
>> 
>> FastAPI-MCP is an open-source project maintained by Tadata Inc. The community is active, with ongoing discussions, issues, and pull requests on the GitHub repository. If you encounter any issues or have questions, you can refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/blob/main/docs/00_FAQ.md) or open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp/issues).
>> 
>> ---
>> 
>> ### Conclusion
>> 
>> FastAPI-MCP offers a streamlined and efficient way to expose your FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools, facilitating integration with AI agents and other services that utilize the MCP standard. Its native integration with FastAPI, built-in authentication, and flexible deployment options make it a valuable addition to your development toolkit.

>> 
>> ### 1. **Custom Operation IDs for Clarity**
>> Assign explicit `operation_id` values to your FastAPI routes to ensure that the generated MCP tool names are intuitive and user-friendly. This practice aids in better tool discovery and usability.
