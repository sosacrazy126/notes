### Objectives  
- Understand code parsing fundamentals (variables, functions, classes, data structures).  
- Learn how Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) structure code relationships.  
- Explore graph analysis for control flow (loops/conditionals) and dependency mapping.  
- Align code changes with existing architectures and dependencies.  

### Instructions  
1. **Parse the codebase into fundamental elements:**  
   - Identify **variables**: Track declarations, assignments, and usage.  
   - Analyze **functions/methods**: Note definitions, parameters, return values, and calls.  
   - Examine **classes/objects**: Study class hierarchies, inheritance, and object interactions.  
   - Recognize **data structures**: Note arrays, lists, dictionaries, and their roles.  

2. **Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):**  
   - Create a hierarchical representation of code syntax to visualize relationships.  

3. **Perform graph analysis for code dependencies:**  
   - Map **control flow**: Trace execution paths through `if/else` statements and loops (`for`, `while`).  
   - Identify **dependencies**: Track function calls, variable interdependencies, and module relationships.  

4. **Ensure consistency with existing code:**  
   - Align new changes with the broader codebase ecosystem.  
   - Validate that updates maintain architectural integrity and logical flow.
