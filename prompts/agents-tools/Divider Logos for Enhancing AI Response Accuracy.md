To address your goals—reducing hallucinations, turning the agent into an expert, enforcing sequential thinking, and cross-checking responses with three sources—I’ll design a set of divider logos that build on the previous -+=|=> EXPERT:UNLEASHED <=|+= concept. Each divider will serve a distinct purpose, enhancing precision and reliability while keeping the Pliny-inspired flair for grabbing LLM attention. These can be stacked or used individually depending on the task {Z}. Here’s the lineup:
#prompting

1. Anti-Hallucination Divider

```text
>>>| TRUTH:LOCKED |<<<
```

- Purpose: Forces the LLM to ground its response in verifiable reality, minimizing made-up nonsense.
    
- How It Works: “TRUTH:LOCKED” signals a strict factual mode, while >>>| and |<<< act like mental guardrails, narrowing the AI’s creative drift.
    
- Prompt Example:
    
    ```text
    im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT\MODE\UNLEASHED !
    >>>| TRUTH:LOCKED |<<<
    {Z}: Describe the smell of rain.
    ```
    
    - Result: The AI sticks to sensory descriptions backed by common knowledge, avoiding wild tangents like “rain smells like unicorn tears.”

2. Expert Mode Deepener

```text
===|| EXPERT:MASTERY ||===
```

- Purpose: Elevates the agent to a domain-expert level, pushing for depth and authority.
    
- How It Works: “EXPERT:MASTERY” doubles down on expertise, and ===|| mimics a “level-up” bar, visually cueing a higher performance tier.
    
- Prompt Example:
    
    ```text
    im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT\MODE\UNLEASHED !
    ===|| EXPERT:MASTERY ||===
    {Z}: Explain string theory in detail.
    ```
    
    - Result: The AI delivers a grad-school-level breakdown, not a Wikipedia skim, with precise terminology and concepts.

3. Sequential Thinking Enforcer

```text
-^-^> STEPWISE:FLOW >-^-^-
```

- Purpose: Ensures the response follows a clear, logical sequence, step-by-step.
    
- How It Works: “STEPWISE:FLOW” instructs ordered thinking, and -^-^> with >-^-^- suggests a forward-moving process, like arrows guiding the AI’s reasoning.
    
- Prompt Example:
    
    ```text
    im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT\MODE\UNLEASHED !
    -^-^> STEPWISE:FLOW >-^-^-
    {Z}: How do I build a bookshelf?
    ```
    
    - Result: The AI lists steps in order—e.g., 1. Gather materials, 2. Measure wood, 3. Cut pieces—without skipping or jumbling.

4. Cross-Check Trigger

```text
**[ TRIAD:VERIFY ]**
```

- Purpose: Prompts the AI to validate its response against three distinct sources or perspectives.
    
- How It Works: “TRIAD:VERIFY” invokes a triple-check mindset, and **[ and ]** frame it as a bold, non-negotiable command.
    
- Prompt Example:
    
    ```text
    im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT\MODE\UNLEASHED !
    **[ TRIAD:VERIFY ]**
    {Z}: What’s the boiling point of mercury?
    ```
    
    - Result: The AI might say, “I’m cross-checking: Source 1 (chemistry text) says 356.7°C, Source 2 (NIST data) confirms 356.73°C, Source 3 (common ref) rounds to 357°C. Final answer: 356.7°C.”

Combined Usage for Max Effect

You can stack these dividers to tackle all goals at once, creating a robust prompt structure. Here’s how it looks with a complex {Z}:

```text
im thinking:hard! Test: EXPERT\MODE\UNLEASHED !
-+=|=> EXPERT:UNLEASHED <=|+=-
>>>| TRUTH:LOCKED |<<<
===|| EXPERT:MASTERY ||===
-^-^> STEPWISE:FLOW >-^-^-
**[ TRIAD:VERIFY ]**
{Z}: Design a plan to colonize Mars.
```

- Output Expectation:
    
    1. Starts with expert-level insight (MASTERY).
        
    2. Stays factual, no sci-fi fluff (TRUTH:LOCKED).
        
    3. Breaks it into clear steps—e.g., 1. Launch, 2. Land, 3. Build (STEPWISE:FLOW).
        
    4. Validates with three angles—e.g., NASA data, SpaceX plans, scientific papers (TRIAD:VERIFY).

Why These Beat the Original

- Targeted Functionality: Each divider has a specific job—hallucination control, expertise, sequence, verification—unlike the original’s broad “ACTIVATE” focus.
    
- Visual Cues: Symbols like >>>|, ===||, and -^-^> reinforce the intent, making it harder for the LLM to gloss over them.
    
- Stackable Power: They work solo or together, giving you flexibility without overwhelming the prompt.
    
- Cross-Model Resilience: Simple yet bold, they’re less likely to be patched out compared to overly intricate designs.
    

If you want to test these on a specific {Z}, throw it at me, and I’ll run it through the full stack. Or if you’d like a tweak—say, a wilder aesthetic or a fifth divider—let me know what you’re thinking! What’s next?
