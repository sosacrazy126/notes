# Summary of "it started with open AI 01 next came"

This video explores the evolution and comparison of advanced AI reasoning models, focusing on OpenAI's 01, Gemini 2.0, and the Deep Seek R1 series. It highlights the importance of *Chain of Thought* reasoning, model performance in AI coding tasks, and the impact of prompt engineering on output quality. The presenter uses a benchmarking tool called Thought Bench to analyze models side-by-side, emphasizing how compute scaling correlates with AI impact.

## Introduction and Overview

**[00:00]**  
- Introduction to the progression from OpenAI 01 to Gemini 2.0 and Deep Seek R1 series.  
- The R1 600 billion parameter model offers *virtually limitless rate limits* and superior scaling of compute resources.  
- Emphasizes that *the reasoning process (Chain of Thought)* is as important as the final answer for improving AI prompts.

## Comparing Reasoning Models Side-by-Side

**[01:00] - [03:00]**  
- Demonstration of Thought Bench tool to compare modelsâ€™ responses and internal thoughts to a simple prompt ("ping").  
- Gemini flash thinking and Deep Seek models provide detailed reasoning, while some models like 01 lack visible thought output.  
- OpenAI 01 correctly responds with "pong," showing understanding of the prompt as a network command.

## AI Coding Prompt Benchmarking

**[04:00] - [07:00]**  
- Running AI coding prompts to create a function converting CSVs to DuckDB tables.  
- Models run locally on an M4 Max MacBook Pro and in the cloud.  
- Larger models (Deep Seek 600B, 14B) produce more accurate and complete code.  
- Smaller models (8B, 1.5B) struggle with accuracy and sometimes generate unsafe code (e.g., `rm -rf`).  
- Chain of Thought helps diagnose model errors and understand reasoning patterns.

## Insights from Model Thought Processes

**[07:00] - [09:00]**  
- All Deep Seek R1 distillations share similar reasoning patterns, reflecting their common origin.  
- Models spend significant tokens thinking through problems, with larger models sometimes using fewer tokens but still requiring extensive reasoning.  
- *Thought output provides a new feedback loop* to improve model performance and prompt design.

## Improving Prompts with Structured Instructions

**[09:00] - [12:00]**  
- Using more detailed AI coding prompts reduces unnecessary thinking and improves response quality.  
- Gemini 2.0 and Deep Seek models show more concise thought tokens with clearer instructions.  
- The importance of specifying output format (e.g., code only) to get precise answers.  
- Thought Bench enables comparing multiple models and iterating on prompt design.

## Model Performance and Limitations

**[13:00] - [16:00]**  
- Deep Seek Reasoner and OpenAI 01 provide near-perfect code outputs for DuckDB CSV import tasks.  
- Smaller models (8B, 14B) have difficulty following instructions precisely and produce less reliable code.  
- Using thoughts and responses together helps identify model limitations and improve prompts iteratively.

---

## Scaling and Guiding Smaller Models

**[16:00] - [19:00]**  
- Combining outputs from large models to guide smaller models improves their performance.  
- Adding explicit instructions about DuckDB SQL syntax and table naming helps smaller models generate better code.  
- Side-by-side comparison shows 32B and 14B models improving but still trailing behind top-tier models.  
- The feedback loop between thought and response is key to refining prompt engineering.

## Meta Prompting and Complex Prompt Generation

**[20:00] - [25:00]**  
- Introduction of a *meta prompt* that generates other prompts, demonstrating advanced self-aware AI capabilities.  
- Meta prompt is large (~2000 tokens) and complex, requiring powerful models to understand and execute.  
- Deep Seek R1 and OpenAI 01 successfully generate usable meta prompts; smaller models fail.  
- Meta prompting exemplifies the value of *self-improving AI* and layered prompt engineering.

## Model Pricing and Comparison Table Generation

**[26:00] - [29:00]**  
- Using Thought Bench to generate a model comparison table with pricing and token limits.  
- Deep Seek and OpenAI models provide detailed, structured outputs; smaller models less so.  
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet included for comparison but lacks thought output.  
- The tool helps visualize model capabilities and cost-effectiveness side-by-side.

## Conclusion and Final Thoughts

**[30:00] - [31:22]**  
- The Deep Seek R1 series represents a significant leap in reasoning ability and cost efficiency, making OpenAI 01 less competitive.  
- Scaling compute directly correlates with scaling impact in generative AI.  
- Chain of Thought reasoning is a valuable signal for improving AI prompt design and output quality.  
- Encouragement to engage with the R1 series and share experiences with Chain of Thought models.  
- Call to action: like, comment, subscribe, and keep building with AI.
