# Summary of "Agentic AI Explained" Video

## Overview  
This video explains the concept of **agentic AI**, tracing its development from traditional large language models (LLMs) to sophisticated multi-agent systems. It aims to clarify what agentic AI entails, how it differs from simple LLM usage, and its practical applications anticipated in 2025 and beyond.

---

## [00:00:00] Introduction  
- Introduction to the "Code to Care" series.  
- Focus on **agentic AI** as a key AI trend in 2025.  
- Purpose: clarify the term and its organizational implications.  
- Reference to a related overview video by Nikolai.

---

## [00:02:00] Understanding Compound AI and Compound LLMs  
- LLMs generate text by predicting the next word sequentially.  
- Example prompt: *"Plan a marketing plan for a new product launch."*  
- LLMs produce output incrementally without editing or backtracking.

---

## [00:05:00] Limitations of LLMs: No Backtracking  
- Unlike humans, LLMs do not revise or reflect during generation.  
- Human writing involves multiple drafts and reviews; LLMs typically do not.

---

## [00:07:00] Compound LLM Approach to Improve Output  
- Sequential use of multiple LLMs enhances quality:  
  - **Draft LLM** creates initial content.  
  - **Critique LLM** reviews and identifies gaps.  
  - **Update LLM** revises based on critique.  
- This mimics human iterative writing and improves results.

---

## [00:10:00] Prompt Engineering Insights  
- Google research shows pausing between steps improves LLM accuracy.  
- Compound LLMs leverage this by enabling reflection, critique, and revision.

---

## [00:12:00] Transition to Agentic AI: Three Key Shifts  
1. **LLMs as Agents**  
   - Each agent has a specialized role (drafting, critiquing, finalizing).  
   - Emphasizes modularity and specialization.

2. **Agents Beyond LLMs**  
   - Some agents are external tools or APIs (e.g., Google search, data retrieval).  
   - Workflow example: data request → search → update draft → critique → finalize.

3. **Dynamic Workflow with Orchestrator Agent**  
   - An orchestrator manages the process dynamically, not fixed steps.  
   - Can loop tasks, request data, revise drafts, and decide when to stop (e.g., after 10 iterations).  
   - Compared to an interactive TV show influenced by audience input.

---

## [00:18:00] Summary of Agentic AI Concepts  
- Start with compounding LLMs to improve output.  
- Reframe LLMs as **agents** with distinct roles.  
- Integrate non-LLM tools as agents in workflows.  
- Use an orchestrator agent to dynamically manage and optimize processes.

---

## [00:20:00] Closing Remarks  
- More content on agentic AI and use cases will be shared throughout the year.  
- Encouragement to viewers to engage and consider AI’s future impact on organizations.  
- Invitation to comment and interact with the channel.

---

## Conclusion  
This video provides a foundational understanding of **agentic AI** as an evolution from single LLM usage to a multi-agent, dynamically orchestrated system. It highlights the importance of modularity, tool integration, and iterative workflows to enhance AI capabilities in practical applications. Viewers are encouraged to explore these concepts to prepare for AI developments in 2025.
