## Key Features of Marimo Notebooks

### Reactive UI and Data Visualization

- [00:01:17] Marimo supports reactive variables and UI components (sliders, checkboxes) that update dependent cells automatically.
- [00:03:00] Demonstration of reactive data visualization with charts that update based on user input.
- [00:03:41] Conditional output and control flow with interactive elements like checkboxes and CSV file uploads.
- [00:04:16] Advanced UI components including accordions, tabs, forms, images, and videos enable rich interactive data exploration.

### Developer and User Modes

- [00:04:35] Switching between **User Mode** (simple UI for consuming notebooks) and **Builder/Engineering Mode** (view and edit underlying code).
- [00:05:01] Declarative UI design inspired by frameworks like Swift UI, allowing quick layout changes (e.g., vertical to horizontal stacks).
- [00:06:01] Fully reactive updates demonstrated with dynamic UI elements reacting to user input.
