# Summary of "you've probably already been swarmed"

This video provides an in-depth analysis of the new AI model "03 mini," comparing it to previous models like 01 and DeepSeek R1. The presenter shares a structured three-step process to evaluate AI models: Vibe check, comparison, and evaluation through benchmarks. The focus is on understanding 03 mini’s capabilities, cost-effectiveness, and practical applications in engineering tasks, especially in reasoning and large context handling.

## Overview and Introduction

### [00:00:00] Introduction and Purpose
- The video addresses the hype around 03 mini, DeepSeek, and the US tech ecosystem.
- Emphasizes pushing past hype to focus on **03 mini as a differentiated model** for real engineering work.
- Introduces the three-step evaluation process: **Vibe check, Compare, Eval**.

## Step 1: Vibe Check – Initial Understanding of 03 Mini

### [00:01:00] Extracting Key Information from Meta’s Q4 Report
- Uses a 12K token structured XML prompt to extract data from Meta’s earnings call.
- Runs side-by-side comparisons of 03 mini in high reasoning mode and previous state-of-the-art models.

### [00:02:00] Key Stats and Features of 03 Mini
- 03 mini is **8 times cheaper than 01** but 8 times more expensive than DeepSeek R1.
- Maintains a **200k token context window** and **100k max output tokens**, far exceeding DeepSeek’s 64k context and 8k output.
- Provides **state-of-the-art instruction following** and a unique **reasoning effort setting** to trade off speed, cost, and performance.
- Fastest in low mode; medium and high modes comparable to 01.

## Step 2: Comparison – Side-by-Side Model Analysis

### [00:10:00] Comparing 03 Mini with Other Models
- 03 mini high mode outperforms 01 slightly in accuracy and capabilities.
- 03 mini provides more precise and structured JSON responses.
- DeepSeek and smaller models show limitations in structure and accuracy.
- Reasoning effort modes (low, medium, high) affect output completeness and accuracy.

### [00:12:00] Multi-Model and Multi-Mode Testing
- Uses tools like Thought Bench to run multiple models side-by-side.
- 03 mini’s reasoning effort modes allow flexible performance tuning.
- DeepSeek struggles with complex structured prompts compared to 03 mini and 01.

## Step 3: Evaluation – Benchmarking and Detailed Analysis

### [00:14:00] Benchmarking Process and Insights
- Benchmarks run multiple prompts across models to assess accuracy and cost.
- 03 mini high mode achieves **96% accuracy** with only one incorrect answer.
- 01 and 01 preview perform well but at significantly higher cost and longer runtimes.
- Cost comparison: 03 mini costs under $1 per run vs. $7+ for 01 on large prompts.

### [00:17:00] Importance of Benchmarking for Model Understanding
- Benchmarking reveals **non-deterministic errors** and model strengths.
- Enables prompt optimization and deeper understanding beyond casual testing.
- Highlights the value of **high-quality prompts** with large token contexts.
