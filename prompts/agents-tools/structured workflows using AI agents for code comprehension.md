# OVERVIEW  
What It Does: Provides structured workflows using AI agents for  #codecomprehension, validation, and safe development, even with limited coding experience.  

Why People Use It: Enables non-experts to contribute to production code via systematic AI-assisted workflows and automated guardrails.  

# HOW TO USE IT  
Most Common Syntax:  
```bash  
$ aider --query "[specific request]"  
$ aider --task "[action list]"  
$ guardrail check --rule "[rule name]" --file [file]  
```  

# COMMON USE CASES  
For Generating Codebase Summaries: `aider --query "Summarize purpose and key files"`  
For Visualizing System Flow: Mermaid `graph LR [...]` diagrams  
For Auditing API Call Safety: `aider --task "List API calls and their error handling"`  
For Testing Proposed Code Changes: AI Sandbox "Shadow Mode"  
For Validating Security Rules: `guardrail check --rule "no_hardcoded_secrets"`  
For Real-Time Concept Explanations: `aider --query "Explain [term] like I'm new"`  

# MOST IMPORTANT AND USED OPTIONS AND FEATURES  
- **`aider --query`**: Distill complex code insights (e.g., summaries, explanations) into human-readable outputs.  
- **`aider --task`**: Execute multi-step actions as "Lego Block" tasks, breaking workflows into manageable units.  
- **GuardRail CLI**: Validate code against rules (e.g., no hardcoded secrets) with red/green feedback.  
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visualize data flow/architecture bypassing syntax hurdles.  
- **Shadow Mode**: Propose changes safely for review before execution.  
- **Validation Templates**: Checklists (e.g., `[ ] API timeouts set`) ensure systematic error avoidance.  
- **Agent Orchestration**: Use pre-configured "Detective → Auditor → Reporter" workflows for reliable outputs.
