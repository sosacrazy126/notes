# FastAPI-based Server Implementation

## Overview

- **Implements FastAPI-based server** for real-time WebSocket communication.
- **Uses WebSocket** for client interaction and task updates.

## Task Execution

- **Processes task messages** to trigger execution phases sequentially.
- **Runs research, planning, and implementation agents** in sequence.
- **Maintains client-specific state** and global memory sync.

## Configuration and Validation

- **Validates configurations** against default parameters.
- **Configuration overrides** are applied on top of defaults.

## Error Handling and Connection Management

- **Gracefully handles disconnections** and errors in WebSocket connections.
- **Manages active WebSocket connections** through a dedicated manager.

## Server Structure

| File                  | Description                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **enhanced_server.py** | Core server logic handling WebSocket and tasks.     |
| **Config.py**          | Defines configuration defaults and validation methods. |
| **Websocket_manager.py** | Handles connection setup and broadcasting.          |

## Memory and State Management

- **Memory synchronization** ensures consistent state across task phases.
- **MemorySaver class** handles memory persistence or synchronization.

## Command-Line Interface

- **Provides a command-line interface** for server startup.
- **CLI deployment** simplifies server startup with host and port options.

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Logging in WebSocketManager** helps track connection events.
- **Use structured logging** with levels for better monitoring.

## Future Enhancements

- **Implement authentication middleware** for secure WebSocket connections.
- **Add rate limiting** to prevent API abuse and server overload.
- **Create unit tests** for configuration validation and task workflows.

## Best Practices

- **Always validate user inputs** before processing.
- **Use type hints** for better code readability and maintainability.
- **Follow PEP 8 style guidelines** for consistent code formatting.

## Technical Details

- **FastAPI is used** for building APIs with WebSocket support.
- **The server runs on Uvicorn** as the ASGI server.
- **WebSocket connections** are managed via a dedicated manager class.

## Real-Time Updates

- **Real-time updates via WebSocket** improve user experience during tasks.
- **Sequential agent execution** ensures proper workflow order.

## Modular Code Structure

- **Modular code** enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **Repositories abstract data access**, promoting clean architecture.

## Error Handling

- **Error handling prevents server crashes** from disconnections.
- **Validation ensures valid configurations** before task execution.

## Documentation and Testing

- **Document all public API endpoints** and their expected behavior.
- **Write tests for each component** to ensure functionality.

## Code Quality

- **Use logging instead of print statements** for debugging.
- **Use linters and formatters** to maintain code quality.

## Additional Features

- **Implement task prioritization** for efficient resource allocation.
- **Add metrics tracking** for task execution times and success rates.

## Security and Environment

- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration parameters.
- **Regularly update dependencies** to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

- **FastAPI-based server** provides a robust framework for real-time WebSocket communication.
- **Modular and scalable architecture** ensures maintainability and future enhancements.
