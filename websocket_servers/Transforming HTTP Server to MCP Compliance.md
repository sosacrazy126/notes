To align with MCP standards, I will outline a comprehensive plan to transform the current HTTP-based server into a fully MCP-compliant implementation.

## Current State Assessment

The existing codebase provides:

- A FastAPI-based server with `/mcp` endpoints for repository operations
- GitHub token authentication
- Caching and session management
- Rate limiting

However, it lacks:

- An **MCP-compliant JSON-RPC 2.0** message format
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** support
- Standard MCP tool definitions
- Proper MCP capability declarations
