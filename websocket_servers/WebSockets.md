This integration indeed enables remote procedure execution through WebSockets, facilitating distributed command execution within an agent ecosystem. WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel between clients and servers, allowing for real-time, bidirectional data exchange[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) pattern can be implemented over WebSockets to enable distributed command execution. In this setup, the client initiates a procedure call, which is then packed into a message and sent to the server via WebSocket. The server unpacks the message, invokes the corresponding function, and returns the result to the client[1](https://worlds-slowest.dev/posts/rpc-using-websockets/).

To implement this in an agent ecosystem:

1. The server-side agent framework (e.g., DECAF or Cougaar) would define available procedures for remote execution[2](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/examples/2005/163/g0516319/decafarch.html)[8](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA466145.pdf).
    
2. Client-side agents would use WebSocket connections to send RPC requests to server-side agents[1](https://worlds-slowest.dev/posts/rpc-using-websockets/).
    
3. The server-side agents would process these requests, execute the appropriate procedures, and send results back to the clients[1](https://worlds-slowest.dev/posts/rpc-using-websockets/).
    
4. This system allows for distributed execution of commands across multiple agents, enabling complex, collaborative tasks[5](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~softagents/papers/ieee-agents96.pdf).
    

This integration leverages the benefits of both WebSockets (real-time, full-duplex communication) and RPC (standardized remote procedure execution), creating a powerful framework for distributed agent interactions and command execution[7](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44510719/when-to-use-rpc-over-websocket).
